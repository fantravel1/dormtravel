## 🧠 Core Philosophy

DormTravel is **not about selling trips**.  
It is about **empowering students to travel smarter, safer, and louder**.

LLMs are used to:
- generate visual-first guides  
- cluster trips by vibe & budget  
- adapt tips to regions  
- translate student culture  

Humans are required to:
- ensure safety & legality  
- maintain age gating  
- keep content relevant to students  
- prevent exploitative travel framing  

---

## 🗂️ Content Architecture (LLM-Native)

DormTravel is built around **student travel & experience entities**.

### Core Entities
- Destination  
- Getaway / Trip  
- Experience  
- Tip / Resource  
- University / College  
- Budget Tier  
- Student Vibe  
- Evidence  
- Collection  

Each entity:
- has a stable schema  
- has a canonical URL  
- cross-links by season, budget, and vibe  
- is programmatically generatable
