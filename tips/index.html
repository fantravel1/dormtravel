            <p class="tip-card-text">Most federal financial aid (including Pell Grants and student loans) can apply to approved study abroad programs. Talk to your financial aid office early since some programs cost the same as a semester on campus. You might spend less abroad than you would at home.</p>

            <p class="tip-card-text">Set aside 15-20% of your total trip budget as an emergency fund in a separate account. This covers unexpected costs like medical visits, lost items, or last-minute itinerary changes. Having an emergency fund means you can handle surprises without cutting your trip short or calling your parents in a panic.</p>

            Always have a mobile hotspot or eSIM as backup for important deadlines and exams. Many hostels advertise WiFi but speeds can be painfully slow during peak hours,

            Choose destinations with manageable time differences - being 6+ hours off makes live classes extremely difficult.

            Find a consistent study spot in each city - routine reduces procrastination even when traveling.

            <p class="tip-card-text">Start with a weekend trip to a nearby city before going international. Solo travel forces you to problem-solve, navigate, and socialize on your own terms. Every solo traveler felt nervous on their first trip, and every one of them says it was worth it.</p>

            <p class="tip-card-text">Hostels with communal areas are perfect for meeting people when traveling alone. Book 4-6 bed dorms for a social vibe or private rooms when you need space. Look for hostels with organized events, walking tours, and communal kitchens.</p>

            <p class="tip-card-text">Use a small tripod with a phone timer, ask friendly tourists for photos (offer to take theirs first), or book a short photography tour. Selfie sticks are banned at many attractions, so a compact tripod with a Bluetooth remote is a better investment.</p>

              <p><strong>Prepare thoroughly</strong> with research, lists, and backup plans to reduce uncertainty. Start with shorter trips before big international ones, travel with friends for your first few trips, download offline resources so you are never truly lost, practice deep breathing techniques, focus on what excites you about the destination, and accept that some discomfort is normal and part of growth. Your campus counseling center can also help with pre-trip anxiety strategies.</p>

              <p>Arrive at the airport <strong>2-3 hours early</strong> for international flights and check in online 24 hours before. Pack liquids in a clear quart-sized bag (3.4oz max each), wear easy-to-remove shoes for security, bring entertainment and snacks, chew gum during takeoff and landing to help your ears, stay hydrated, download your airline's app for mobile boarding passes, choose an aisle seat if you like to move around, and don't stress about turbulence - it is completely normal and safe.</p>

              <p>Use a <strong>crossbody bag with zippers</strong> (never an open backpack in crowded areas), keep your phone in a front pocket, be extra alert at tourist hotspots and on public transit, never keep your wallet in your back pocket, use a money belt for large amounts of cash, be wary of distractions (someone bumping into you or people with clipboards), don't flash expensive jewelry or electronics, keep bags on your lap in restaurants, and split cash between multiple locations on your body.</p>

              <p>Keep a <strong>daily travel journal</strong> (even just 5 minutes before bed), take photos during golden hour for the best lighting, create short video clips for a trip montage, use <strong>Google Photos</strong> to auto-backup and organize by location, start a travel blog or Instagram account, collect small souvenirs like postcards or ticket stubs, write down funny quotes and memorable moments, use Polarsteps to auto-track your route, and most importantly - put the phone down sometimes and just be present in the moment.</p>
