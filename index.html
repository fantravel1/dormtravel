Domestic flights are cheapest 1-3 months ahead, while international flights should be booked 2-5 months out. Study abroad programs often have application deadlines 6-12 months before departure.

Contact your insurance provider as soon as possible - most require notification within 24-48 hours. File claims online through your provider's portal (World Nomads, SafetyWing, or your university's plan). Keep copies of your policy number, boarding passes, and proof of expenses.

It fits as a carry-on, works as a hiking pack, and avoids checked bag fees. For weekend trips, a personal-item-sized backpack (18x14x8 inches) lets you fly on Spirit/Frontier for free. Look for bags with laptop compartments, compression straps, and lockable zippers. Avoid hard-shell suitcases for backpacking trips."

Establish a routine (morning coffee spot, evening walk) to create familiarity. Bring a small comfort item from home. Stay busy with activities and socializing.

Travel health insurance covers emergency medical treatment, hospital stays, medical evacuation, and emergency dental in foreign countries. It's typically $1-$3 per day for students. Travel insurance (different from health insurance) also covers trip cancellation, lost luggage, and flight delays. For study abroad, many universities require you to have both."

              <p>Join your campus <strong>travel club or study abroad office</strong> events. Post in your school's Facebook groups, subreddit, or Discord servers. Apps like <strong>Travello and Backpackr</strong> connect travelers by destination. Check if your university has a ride-share board for road trips. Many hostels also have <strong>group activity boards</strong> where solo travelers can join excursions. The DormTravel Discord is also a great place to find students heading to the same destinations.</p>

              <p>The <strong>ISIC card (International Student Identity Card)</strong> is the gold standard - accepted in 130+ countries for discounts on museums, transport, food, and accommodation. <strong>Student Beans</strong> and <strong>UNiDAYS</strong> offer online deals on travel bookings. Many European museums are <strong>free for students under 26</strong> with a valid student ID. Rail passes (Eurail, JR Pass) often have youth/student rates. Always carry your student ID and ask about discounts everywhere - you'd be surprised how many places offer them.</p>

              <p>First, <strong>document everything</strong>: take photos, get police reports for theft, keep all medical receipts and bills. Contact your insurance provider as soon as possible - most require notification within <strong>24-48 hours</strong>. File claims online through your provider's portal (World Nomads, SafetyWing, or your university's plan). Keep copies of your <strong>policy number, boarding passes, and proof of expenses</strong>. Most claims are processed within 2-4 weeks. If your university provides coverage, start with their study abroad office.</p>

              <p>For budget airlines, a <strong>40L travel backpack</strong> (like the Osprey Fairview or Cotopaxi Allpa) is the best investment. It fits as a carry-on, works as a hiking pack, and avoids checked bag fees. For weekend trips, a <strong>personal-item-sized backpack</strong> (18x14x8 inches) lets you fly on Spirit/Frontier for free. Look for bags with <strong>laptop compartments, compression straps, and lockable zippers</strong>. Avoid hard-shell suitcases for backpacking trips - they're impossible on cobblestone streets and hostel stairs.</p>

              <p>Homesickness is <strong>completely normal</strong> - even seasoned travelers feel it. Schedule regular video calls with family and friends, but don't let them replace making new connections. <strong>Establish a routine</strong> (morning coffee spot, evening walk) to create familiarity. Bring a small comfort item from home. <strong>Stay busy</strong> with activities and socializing. If it persists, talk to your study abroad advisor or a counselor. It usually fades after 2-3 weeks as you settle into your new environment.</p>

              <p>Working holiday visas let you <strong>live and work abroad for 6-12 months</strong>. Popular countries include Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, and South Korea. Most require you to be <strong>18-30 years old</strong> and have proof of funds ($2,000-$5,000). You can work in hospitality, farming, or tourism to fund your travels. Apply directly through the country's immigration website. <strong>Australia's Working Holiday visa</strong> is the most popular for American students and lets you work up to 6 months with one employer.</p>

            </button>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>Your regular health insurance <strong>likely doesn't cover you abroad</strong> (even many US plans don't cover you outside your state network). Travel health insurance covers <strong>emergency medical treatment, hospital stays, medical evacuation, and emergency dental</strong> in foreign countries. It's typically $1-$3 per day for students. <strong>Travel insurance</strong> (different from health insurance) also covers trip cancellation, lost luggage, and flight delays. For study abroad, many universities require you to have both. Always check what your existing plan covers before buying additional coverage.</p>
