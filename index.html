              <p>Yes, with planning. Use <strong>long weekends and reading weeks</strong> for short trips. Many professors post lectures online, so check your syllabus for attendance policies. Friday-to-Sunday trips work great for nearby destinations. Consider destinations within a 2-3 hour flight. Pro tip: avoid traveling during midterms and finals. Some students strategically <strong>schedule Tuesday/Thursday classes</strong> to create long weekends for travel.</p>
