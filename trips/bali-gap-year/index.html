Common-sense precautions apply: watch your belongings in crowded areas like Ubud Market, avoid walking alone on unlit roads late at night, and be cautious on scooters. The biggest risks are petty theft (bag snatching from scooters) and road accidents. Stick to well-traveled areas like Ubud, Canggu, Seminyak, and Uluwatu, and you'll feel completely at ease. The digital nomad community is huge, so you'll quickly meet other solo travelers at co-working spaces like Dojo Bali or Outpost Canggu."

This gives you 30 days and can be extended once for another 30 days at a local immigration office (total 60 days). For longer stays, you can apply for a B211A social/cultural visa before arriving, which gives you 60 days and can be extended up to 180 days. Digital nomads often do visa runs to nearby countries like Singapore or Malaysia and re-enter for a fresh 30-day VOA. Always check the latest requirements before traveling as Indonesia periodically updates its visa policies."

The sweet spots are April-June and September-October -- you get perfect weather, fewer tourists, and lower prices. The wet season (November-March) brings daily rain showers but they're usually short afternoon bursts, and you'll find the cheapest accommodation and emptiest beaches. Many long-term travelers actually prefer wet season for the deals and lush green scenery."

Yoga retreats in Ubud, temple visits at Tirta Empul and Tanah Lot, rice terrace walks at Tegallalang, cooking classes, waterfall hikes, snorkeling at Nusa Penida, beach club lounging at Potato Head, diving at the Gili Islands, and just exploring on a scooter. That said, Bali is the perfect place to learn -- beginner surf lessons at beaches like Kuta and Canggu are cheap ($20-30) and the instructors are patient and experienced. You might surprise yourself!"

Canggu is the digital nomad capital with dozens of co-working spaces like Dojo Bali, Outpost, and the legendary Deus Ex Machina cafe. WiFi speeds at co-working spaces typically range from 30-100 Mbps. A co-working membership costs $100-200/month. Many cafes also have reliable WiFi -- just buy a coffee and work for hours. Get a local SIM card from Telkomsel for backup mobile data. Note: technically you need a business visa to legally work, but enforcement for remote workers on tourist visas is minimal."

A meal at a local warung (small family restaurant) costs $1-3. A smoothie bowl at a trendy Canggu cafe costs $6-10. A private room in a homestay is $15-25/night, while a villa with a pool can be $50-150/night. Scooter rental is $50-70/month. The key is balance -- eat at warungs for most meals, splurge occasionally at nice restaurants, share a villa with friends, and your total monthly cost can genuinely be $1,000-1,500. Budget backpackers can do it for under $1,000/month."

For authentic experiences, eat where locals eat at warungs, explore beyond the main tourist streets, hire local guides through your homestay rather than big tour companies, and visit temples early morning before tour buses arrive. Tanah Lot at sunrise instead of sunset is a game-changer."

          "text": "Scooter rental is the most popular and affordable option at $50-70/month, giving you total freedom to explore. However, Bali traffic can be intense, especially around Kuta, Seminyak, and Denpasar. If you're not comfortable on a scooter, hiring a private driver for the day costs $30-50 and is safer for longer distances or mountain roads. Grab (Southeast Asia's Uber) is available in most areas for short trips. For getting between regions (like Ubud to Uluwatu), private drivers are the way to go. Many travelers use a scooter for daily errands and hire a driver for day trips. Always wear a helmet, get an international driving permit, and practice in a quiet area before hitting busy roads."

The digital nomad visa (B211A) is now available for remote workers and allows stays of up to 6 months with extensions.

The most effective strategy is to schedule online classes for Bali evening, which corresponds to US morning. Co-working spaces have dedicated Zoom rooms with soundproofing and fast internet. WiFi in Canggu and Ubud is reliable enough for live lectures and video calls. Many students complete their final semester remotely from Bali without their professors even noticing the time zone difference."

          "text": "Bali belly affects almost every visitor in the first week as your stomach adjusts to new bacteria. Prevention: eat at busy warungs where food turnover is high, drink only sealed bottled water, and avoid ice in drinks at sketchy-looking establishments. If it hits you, the treatment protocol is: Imodium for immediate relief, activated charcoal tablets to absorb toxins, Pocari Sweat electrolyte drinks (available at every Indomaret and Alfamart minimart), and rest. It usually passes within 24-48 hours. If symptoms persist beyond 3 days or include high fever, visit a clinic -- BIMC Hospital in Kuta is expat-friendly and English-speaking."

You'll change into a sarong (provided), wade into the cool spring water, and move through a series of fountains, each representing a different spiritual cleansing. Local worshippers will often guide you through the ritual. It's deeply spiritual, profoundly humbling, and one of the most authentic cultural experiences you can have in Bali. Go early morning to avoid crowds.</p>

The waves are gentle, forgiving whitewater -- perfect for standing up for the first time. Yes, Kuta is crowded and touristy, but for learning to surf, the wide sandy bottom and consistent small waves can't be beat. Dozens of surf schools line the beach, all offering similar quality lessons.</p>

Board rental is $5/day. The vibe here is incredible -- watch the sunset lineup from Old Man's bar right on the beach, cold Bintang in hand, as surfers carve the golden-hour waves.

If you're not ready to paddle out, it's still an incredible spot to watch from the beach warungs that serve $3 nasi goreng and $2 Bintangs.

Even if you're not ready to surf here, watching the pros from the cliff-top cafes is mesmerizing. Padang Padang beach below offers a front-row seat to world-class surfing.

          <div class="pro-tip-text">Take at least 3 lessons before renting a board solo. Bali currents are no joke -- rip currents can pull you out quickly if you don't know how to read the water. Also: reef shoes. The coral bottom at many Bali breaks will slice your feet open. A $10 pair of reef booties will save you a lot of pain and potential infections.</div>

            <p class="tip-card-text">The cultural and spiritual heart of Bali. Jungle-covered hills, the legendary Tegallalang Rice Terraces, yoga retreats, art galleries, and the Sacred Monkey Forest. Best for wellness seekers, creatives, and anyone doing the Eat Pray Love thing. Quieter nightlife, amazing vegetarian food, and a slower pace of life. Visit the Ubud Market early morning for the best deals on handcrafted goods.</p>

            <p class="tip-card-text">The digital nomad capital of the world. Co-working spaces like Dojo Bali and Outpost everywhere, world-class surf breaks at Echo Beach and Batu Bolong, and the trendiest cafe scene in Southeast Asia. Home to Deus Ex Machina (motorcycles, coffee, culture). Best for remote workers, surfers, and the "laptop lifestyle" crowd. Rapidly developing but still has rice field views between the cafes.</p>

            <p class="tip-card-text">The upscale beach zone. Trendy boutiques, high-end restaurants, beach clubs like Potato Head and La Plancha, and the most vibrant nightlife on the island. Best for those who want beach vibes with a touch of luxury. More expensive than Canggu but more polished. The sunset strip along the beach is legendary -- golden hour here is genuinely world-class.</p>

Hidden beaches accessible by steep staircases (Padang Padang, Nyang Nyang). Best for surfers and those seeking dramatic scenery over convenience. More spread out -- a scooter is essential here.</p>

            <p class="tip-card-text">The wild, rugged island off Bali's southeast coast. Kelingking Beach (the T-Rex cliff), Crystal Bay, Broken Beach, and Angel's Billabong are some of the most dramatic landscapes in Indonesia. Swim with manta rays and sea turtles. Infrastructure is basic and roads are rough -- that's part of the charm. Best for adventure seekers and photographers.</p>

            <p class="tip-card-text">Three tiny paradise islands off Bali's coast -- no cars, no motorbikes, just bicycles and horse carts. Gili Trawangan is the party island with bars and nightlife. Gili Air is the chill alternative with yoga and hammocks. Gili Meno is the quiet escape. All three offer incredible snorkeling with sea turtles right off the beach. The underwater sculpture garden is surreal.</p>

            <p class="tip-card-text">Dojo Bali in Canggu is the OG -- rice paddy views, community events, and fast WiFi ($100-150/month). Outpost Canggu offers a more professional vibe with meeting rooms ($150-200/month). BWork in Ubud brings co-working to the jungle. Tropical Nomad in Seminyak is great for short stays ($15/day). Most spaces offer free trial days, air conditioning, coffee, and networking events. Deus Ex Machina doubles as a cafe-coworking hybrid with incredible coffee and motorcycle culture.</p>

            <p class="tip-card-text">Co-working spaces offer 30-100 Mbps. Many cafes in Canggu and Ubud have solid WiFi -- Crate Cafe, Milk &amp; Madu, Seniman Coffee in Ubud, and Revolver Espresso in Seminyak are digital nomad favorites. Get a Telkomsel SIM card for backup mobile hotspot ($10-15/month for 15-30GB). Villa WiFi varies wildly, so test speed before committing to a long stay. Starlink is increasingly available at premium accommodations.</p>

            <p class="tip-card-text">Bali's nomad community is massive and welcoming. Dojo Bali hosts weekly events -- skill shares, founder talks, and social nights. NomadList meetups happen monthly. Facebook groups like "Canggu Community" and "Digital Nomads Bali" post daily events. Sunday sessions at Old Man's are unofficial networking events. Surf groups, yoga communities, and running clubs are all easy ways to meet people. You'll never eat dinner alone unless you want to.</p>

            <p class="tip-card-text">The Bali schedule: sunrise surf or yoga (6-7 AM), healthy breakfast (8 AM), focused work block (9 AM-1 PM), lunch and explore (1-3 PM), second work block or activities (3-5 PM), sunset session (5:30-7 PM). Most nomads work 4-6 hours/day and spend the rest exploring. Weekdays for work, weekends for adventures like Nusa Penida day trips or volcano hikes. The key is routine -- without one, the Bali "holiday mode" will swallow your productivity.</p>

            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>Yes, Bali is one of the safest destinations in Southeast Asia for solo travelers, including solo female travelers. The Balinese people are incredibly friendly and welcoming. Common-sense precautions apply: watch your belongings in crowded areas like Ubud Market, avoid walking alone on unlit roads late at night, and be cautious on scooters. The biggest risks are petty theft (bag snatching from scooters) and road accidents. Stick to well-traveled areas like Ubud, Canggu, Seminyak, and Uluwatu, and you'll feel completely at ease. The digital nomad community is huge, so you'll quickly meet other solo travelers at co-working spaces like Dojo Bali or Outpost Canggu.</p>

            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>Most nationalities can get a Visa on Arrival (VOA) at Ngurah Rai International Airport for around $35 USD. This gives you 30 days and can be extended once for another 30 days at a local immigration office (total 60 days). For longer stays, you can apply for a B211A social/cultural visa before arriving, which gives you 60 days and can be extended up to 180 days. Digital nomads often do visa runs to nearby countries like Singapore or Malaysia and re-enter for a fresh 30-day VOA. Always check the latest requirements before traveling as Indonesia periodically updates its visa policies.</p>

            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>The best time to visit Bali is during the dry season from April to October. July and August are peak tourist season with the highest prices and biggest crowds. The sweet spots are April-June and September-October -- you get perfect weather, fewer tourists, and lower prices. The wet season (November-March) brings daily rain showers but they're usually short afternoon bursts, and you'll find the cheapest accommodation and emptiest beaches. Many long-term travelers actually prefer wet season for the deals and lush green scenery.</p>

            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>Absolutely not! While Bali is world-famous for surfing, there's so much more to do. Yoga retreats in Ubud, temple visits at Tirta Empul and Tanah Lot, rice terrace walks at Tegallalang, cooking classes, waterfall hikes, snorkeling at Nusa Penida, beach club lounging at Potato Head, diving at the Gili Islands, and just exploring on a scooter. That said, Bali is the perfect place to learn -- beginner surf lessons at beaches like Kuta and Canggu are cheap ($20-30) and the instructors are patient and experienced. You might surprise yourself!</p>

            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>Bali is one of the top digital nomad destinations in the world, and yes, remote work is very doable. Canggu is the digital nomad capital with dozens of co-working spaces like Dojo Bali, Outpost, and the legendary Deus Ex Machina cafe. WiFi speeds at co-working spaces typically range from 30-100 Mbps. A co-working membership costs $100-200/month. Many cafes also have reliable WiFi -- just buy a coffee and work for hours. Get a local SIM card from Telkomsel for backup mobile data. Note: technically you need a business visa to legally work, but enforcement for remote workers on tourist visas is minimal.</p>

            </button>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>Yes and no. Bali can be incredibly cheap if you live like a local, or surprisingly expensive if you stick to tourist hotspots. A meal at a local warung (small family restaurant) costs $1-3. A smoothie bowl at a trendy Canggu cafe costs $6-10. A private room in a homestay is $15-25/night, while a villa with a pool can be $50-150/night. Scooter rental is $50-70/month. The key is balance -- eat at warungs for most meals, splurge occasionally at nice restaurants, share a villa with friends, and your total monthly cost can genuinely be $1,000-1,500. Budget backpackers can do it for under $1,000/month.</p>

            </button>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>The biggest tourist traps in Bali include overpriced taxi drivers at the airport (use Grab or pre-book a transfer), the Bali Swing in Ubud (overcrowded and overpriced at $35 -- find smaller, cheaper swings nearby), overcharging at Ubud Market (always negotiate, start at 30% of asking price), and money changers offering "no commission" on Kuta streets (use ATMs or official exchanges instead). For authentic experiences, eat where locals eat at warungs, explore beyond the main tourist streets, hire local guides through your homestay rather than big tour companies, and visit temples early morning before tour buses arrive. Tanah Lot at sunrise instead of sunset is a game-changer.</p>

            </button>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>Scooter rental is the most popular and affordable option at $50-70/month, giving you total freedom to explore. However, Bali traffic can be intense, especially around Kuta, Seminyak, and Denpasar. If you're not comfortable on a scooter, hiring a private driver for the day costs $30-50 and is safer for longer distances or mountain roads. Grab (Southeast Asia's Uber) is available in most areas for short trips. For getting between regions (like Ubud to Uluwatu), private drivers are the way to go. Many travelers use a scooter for daily errands and hire a driver for day trips. Always wear a helmet, get an international driving permit, and practice in a quiet area before hitting busy roads.</p>
