Even nicer restaurants rarely exceed $5-10. Beer is $1.50-3, and cocktail buckets at Full Moon Party run 200-350 THB ($6-10). The biggest expense is your international flight."

The best overall window is November to April when most of the country is dry and sunny. However, even during monsoon season, rain usually comes in short afternoon bursts -- you can still enjoy your trip. Prices drop significantly during the wet season."

ATMs are everywhere but charge a flat 220 THB ($6.30) foreign transaction fee per withdrawal, so always withdraw the maximum amount each time (usually 20,000-30,000 THB) to minimize fees. Wise and Revolut debit cards offer the best exchange rates and lowest fees. Bangkok has excellent exchange booths (SuperRich is the best) that beat airport rates significantly. Credit cards are accepted at hotels and malls but not at street food stalls or markets. Keep small bills (20 and 50 THB notes) for songthaews and street food."

Hepatitis A is the most important as it's spread through contaminated food and water. Malaria pills are only needed for remote jungle border areas near Myanmar and Cambodia, not for Bangkok, Chiang Mai, the islands, or any standard tourist route. Visit a travel clinic 4-6 weeks before departure to allow time for vaccine courses. Most college health centers offer travel consultations.

Bangkok to Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam is $40-50 (2 hours). Many backpackers combine Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam into a 4-6 week mega-trip for under $3,000 total. Cambodia e-visa is available online for $36. Vietnam e-visa is $25 online. You can also do overland border crossings: bus from Bangkok to Siem Reap ($20-25, 8 hours). The Bangkok-Siem Reap route is the most popular add-on for students with an extra 3-4 days."

White sand that squeaks under your feet. From the party vibes of Koh Phangan to the diving paradise of Koh Tao to the secluded shores of Koh Lipe -- there's an island for every mood.</p>

            <h3 class="tip-card-title">Rich Culture &amp; Temples</h3>
            <p class="tip-card-text">Thailand's 40,000+ Buddhist temples will take your breath away. Wat Phra Kaew (Temple of the Emerald Buddha) in Bangkok is otherworldly. The ancient ruins of Ayutthaya feel like stepping into a time machine. Thai culture is warm, welcoming, and deeply spiritual -- it adds a dimension to your trip that pure party destinations simply can't match.</p>

            <p class="tip-card-text">They don't call it "The Land of Smiles" for nothing. Thai people are genuinely some of the warmest, most welcoming humans you'll ever meet. Get lost in Bangkok? Someone will walk you to your destination. Need directions to Thong Sala pier? Three locals will personally escort you. The Thai concept of "sanuk" (having fun) permeates everything.</p>

            <p class="tip-card-text">From Bangkok's rooftop sky bars to Khao San Road's neon-lit madness to the ultimate Full Moon Party on Haad Rin beach -- Thailand's nightlife is in a league of its own. Bucket drinks for $3, fire shows on the beach, open-air clubs bumping until sunrise. And the Full Moon Party? 30,000 people from every corner of the globe, all dancing under the stars. Nothing else comes close.</p>

          <h2 class="section-title">The Thailand Experience: <span class="gradient-text">2 Weeks vs 3 Weeks</span></h2>
          <p class="section-subtitle">The eternal backpacker debate. Two weeks is enough to hit the highlights. Three weeks lets you actually breathe. Here's what each looks like so you can match the trip to your schedule and budget.</p>
        </div>

              <div class="dest-card-price">$1,200 - $1,800</div>
              <p class="dest-card-text"><strong>Route:</strong> Bangkok (3 days) &#8594; Chiang Mai (2 days) &#8594; Koh Phangan / Full Moon Party (4 days) &#8594; Koh Samui (2 days) &#8594; Fly home.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-text"><strong>Pace:</strong> Fast-paced, hits all the major highlights, best for semester breaks or winter break when you only have 2 weeks off. You'll see the Grand Palace, do a cooking class, party under the full moon, and island-hop the Gulf -- all in 14 days.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-text"><strong>&#10003; Pro:</strong> Cheaper overall, more focused itinerary, less time off school. You still get the Full Moon Party and the core Thailand experience.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-text"><strong>&#10007; Con:</strong> Feels rushed. You'll wish you had more time on the islands. No time for Koh Tao diving or side trips to Pai or Ayutthaya. Travel days eat into your beach time.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-text"><strong>Best for:</strong> Students on a tight schedule, first-time backpackers, semester break trips, groups who want structure.</p>

              <p class="dest-card-text"><strong>Pace:</strong> Relaxed and immersive. Enough time to actually decompress, discover hidden gems, get your PADI diving certification, wander through Pai's hippie canyon, and explore the jaw-dropping limestone cliffs of Railay Beach. This is the real backpacker experience.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-text"><strong>&#10003; Pro:</strong> The genuine Southeast Asia experience. Time to slow down, meet other travelers, and stumble into the unplanned adventures that become your best stories. Includes diving, Pai, and the Andaman coast.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-text"><strong>&#10007; Con:</strong> Need 3 weeks off school -- usually only works for summer break or gap semesters. Slightly higher total cost (though daily spending stays the same).</p>
              <p class="dest-card-text"><strong>Best for:</strong> Summer trips, gap semester travelers, solo backpackers, anyone who wants the full Thailand experience without feeling rushed.</p>

          <div class="pro-tip-label">&#128161; Pro Tip -- Trip Length</div>
          <div class="pro-tip-text">The 3-week version is only about $600 more than the 2-week trip because Thailand is so incredibly cheap day-to-day. That extra week costs roughly $85/day for accommodation, food, transport, and activities combined. If you can swing the extra week off school, do it. You won't regret having more time -- but you will regret cutting the trip short. Many students say their biggest mistake was not booking enough days.</div>

            <div class="pro-tip-text">Take the BTS Skytrain and MRT instead of tuk-tuks for long distances -- it's air-conditioned, fast, and costs 16-59 THB ($0.45-$1.70) vs. 100-200 THB for a tuk-tuk ride. Save tuk-tuks for short hops and the experience. And always agree on a price BEFORE getting in.</div>

              <div class="dest-card-price">$25 - $40/day</div>
              <p class="dest-card-text"><strong>Vibe:</strong> &#128293;&#128293;&#128293;&#128293;&#128293; -- The epicenter of the Full Moon Party and Thailand's most famous party island. Haad Rin beach transforms into a 30,000-person open-air rave every full moon. But beyond the parties, Koh Phangan has a lush jungle interior, hidden waterfalls, and yoga retreats that attract a surprisingly spiritual crowd.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-text"><strong>Best for:</strong> The main event. If the Full Moon Party is on your bucket list, this is non-negotiable. Also great for the Half Moon Festival (jungle party) and Waterfall parties mid-month.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-text"><strong>Key spots:</strong> Haad Rin beach (Full Moon Party), Thong Nai Pan (quiet beaches), Bottle Beach (jungle hike access only), Than Sadet Waterfall, Thong Sala (main pier town with night market).</p>
              <p class="dest-card-text"><strong>Getting there:</strong> Ferry from Surat Thani (Donsak pier) -- Lomprayah catamaran 2.5 hours, 600 THB ($17). Or ferry from Koh Samui (30 min, 300 THB) or Koh Tao (1.5 hours, 350-600 THB).</p>

              <div class="dest-card-price">$20 - $35/day</div>
              <p class="dest-card-text"><strong>Vibe:</strong> &#128293;&#128293;&#128293; -- Small, chill, and built around diving culture. Koh Tao is where backpackers from all over the world come to get their PADI Open Water certification for $250 -- the cheapest in the world. The island is tiny enough to explore on foot, and the nightlife on Sairee Beach is fun without being overwhelming.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-text"><strong>Best for:</strong> Diving + relaxation. Even if you don't dive, the snorkeling is world-class (Shark Bay has actual black-tip reef sharks and sea turtles). Perfect for 2-3 day stays between Koh Phangan and Koh Samui.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-text"><strong>Key spots:</strong> Sairee Beach (main strip, bars, restaurants), Shark Bay (snorkeling), Japanese Gardens (dive site), Tanote Bay (cliff jumping), John Suwan viewpoint (sunset hike).</p>
              <p class="dest-card-text"><strong>Getting there:</strong> Ferry from Koh Phangan (1.5 hours, Lomprayah catamaran 600 THB / $17) or from Chumphon on the mainland (1.5-3 hours depending on boat type).</p>

              <div class="dest-card-price">$30 - $60/day</div>
              <p class="dest-card-text"><strong>Vibe:</strong> &#128293;&#128293;&#128293;&#128293; -- The most developed Gulf island with its own international airport. Koh Samui has everything: luxury resorts next to budget hostels, raging nightlife in Chaweng, and a famous ladyboy cabaret show. It's the island where backpackers and luxury travelers coexist.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-text"><strong>Best for:</strong> Comfort seekers who still want a good time. Great as a first or last stop because of the airport. The nightlife in Chaweng is excellent -- bars, clubs, and beach parties 7 nights a week.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-text"><strong>Key spots:</strong> Chaweng Beach (main party strip), Lamai Beach (more relaxed), Big Buddha Temple (Wat Phra Yai), Fisherman's Village Bophut (Friday walking market), Ang Thong National Marine Park (day trip).</p>
              <p class="dest-card-text"><strong>Getting there:</strong> Direct flights from Bangkok (1 hour, Bangkok Airways from 1,500 THB / $42), or ferry from Surat Thani (Donsak pier, 1.5 hours, 400 THB / $11).

              <div class="dest-card-price">$25 - $45/day</div>
              <p class="dest-card-text"><strong>Vibe:</strong> &#128293;&#128293; -- Crystal-clear Andaman Sea water that rivals the Maldives, no cars on the island, and the most remote feel of any Thai island that's still accessible. Koh Lipe is tiny -- you can walk the entire island in 30 minutes -- but the water is unreal. Think turquoise gradients you didn't know existed in real life.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-text"><strong>Best for:</strong> Off-grid escape. If you want to disappear from the world for 3-4 days with nothing but pristine beaches, amazing snorkeling, and beachfront seafood restaurants. No ATMs (bring cash), limited WiFi, pure paradise.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-text"><strong>Key spots:</strong> Sunrise Beach (east side, best snorkeling), Pattaya Beach (main beach, restaurants), Sunset Beach (west side, quiet). Snorkeling trips to Koh Adang and Koh Rawi nearby.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-text"><strong>Getting there:</strong> Speedboat from Pak Bara pier in Satun province (1.5 hours, 750 THB / $21). Nearest airports are Hat Yai or Trang (then 2-3 hour drive to pier). Only accessible November-May; most boats don't run in monsoon season.</p>

              <div class="dest-card-price">$25 - $50/day</div>
              <p class="dest-card-text"><strong>Vibe:</strong> &#128293;&#128293;&#128293;&#128293;&#128293; -- This is where Leonardo DiCaprio's "The Beach" was filmed, and the party scene here is absolutely insane. Maya Bay (now reopened with visitor limits) has some of the most stunning water on Earth. The island itself is car-free with dramatic limestone cliffs rising from emerald water.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-text"><strong>Best for:</strong> Leonardo DiCaprio fans, party animals, and Instagram addicts. The combination of jaw-dropping natural beauty and wild nightlife makes Phi Phi a must-visit. Fire shows on the beach every night, pool parties by day.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-text"><strong>Key spots:</strong> Maya Bay (The Beach filming location, pre-book entry 400 THB / $11), Tonsai Village (main town, bars), Viking Cave, Phi Phi Viewpoint (sweaty hike, insane panorama), Long Beach (snorkeling).</p>
              <p class="dest-card-text"><strong>Getting there:</strong> Ferry from Phuket (2 hours, 450 THB / $13) or Krabi (1.5 hours, 400 THB / $11). Most people visit as part of an Andaman coast route: Krabi &#8594; Phi Phi &#8594; Phuket.</p>

              <div class="dest-card-price">$20 - $35/day</div>
              <p class="dest-card-text"><strong>Vibe:</strong> &#128293; -- The anti-party island. Koh Lanta is long, flat, and beautifully mellow. Endless beaches that you'll often have entirely to yourself, fiery sunsets that turn the whole sky orange, and a laid-back reggae-bar scene that's perfect for unwinding after the chaos of Phi Phi or the Full Moon Party. This island moves at half speed and that's the entire point.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-text"><strong>Best for:</strong> Introverts, couples, and anyone who needs to decompress. If you've been partying hard for a week and need 2-3 days of doing absolutely nothing on a beautiful beach with a good book, Koh Lanta is your island.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-text"><strong>Key spots:</strong> Long Beach (most popular, still quiet), Kantiang Bay (secluded, stunning), Old Town (charming waterfront village), Mu Ko Lanta National Park (southern tip, lighthouse, monkeys).</p>
              <p class="dest-card-text"><strong>Getting there:</strong> Ferry from Krabi (1 hour, 400 THB / $11), ferry from Phi Phi (1 hour, 350 THB / $10). Also accessible by minivan + car ferry from Krabi airport. Connected by bridge to the mainland in dry season.</p>

          <p class="section-subtitle">Thailand's street food isn't just cheap -- it's genuinely some of the best food on the planet. Anthony Bourdain called Bangkok the greatest street food city in the world. Here are the 8 dishes every college traveler needs to eat, what they cost, and where to find the best versions.</p>

            <h3 class="tip-card-title">Pad Thai -- $1 - $1.50</h3>
            <p class="tip-card-text"><strong>The classic.</strong> Stir-fried rice noodles with egg, tofu or shrimp, bean sprouts, crushed peanuts, and lime. The best pad thai comes from street carts, not restaurants -- look for the vendors with the biggest crowds of locals. Thip Samai on Maha Chai Road in Bangkok is legendary (open from 5 PM, expect a line). Order "pad thai goong" for shrimp or "pad thai kai" for chicken. Squeeze the lime, add chili flakes, and thank us later. 40-60 THB from street carts.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="tip-card fade-in">
            <div class="tip-card-icon">&#129361;</div>
            <h3 class="tip-card-title">Som Tum (Papaya Salad) -- $1</h3>
            <p class="tip-card-text"><strong>Spicy, sour, fresh, crunchy.</strong> Shredded green papaya pounded in a mortar with chili, lime, fish sauce, tomatoes, and peanuts. This is THE quintessential Thai dish and it's intensely flavorful. Warning: Thai-level spicy will melt your face. Say "mai phet" (not spicy) or "phet nit noi" (a little spicy) when ordering. Best from Isaan (northeastern Thai) vendors -- look for the mortar and pestle. 35-50 THB everywhere.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="tip-card fade-in">
            <div class="tip-card-icon">&#129389;</div>
            <h3 class="tip-card-title">Mango Sticky Rice -- $1.50</h3>
            <p class="tip-card-text"><strong>The GOAT dessert.</strong> Sweet glutinous rice soaked in coconut cream, served with perfectly ripe mango slices and a drizzle of coconut sauce. Simple, heavenly, and the reason you'll gain 5 pounds in Thailand. Peak mango season is March through June when the Nam Dok Mai mangoes are at their sweetest. Available at markets, food courts, and carts everywhere. Mae Varee near BTS Thong Lo in Bangkok is famous for it. 50-60 THB.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="tip-card fade-in">
            <div class="tip-card-icon">&#127858;</div>
            <h3 class="tip-card-title">Khao Soi -- $1.50</h3>
            <p class="tip-card-text"><strong>Chiang Mai's crown jewel.</strong> A rich coconut curry noodle soup topped with crispy fried noodles, pickled cabbage, shallots, and lime. This northern Thai specialty is life-changing -- creamy, spicy, crunchy, and deeply savory all at once. Khao Soi Khun Yai in Chiang Mai is consistently voted the best (40-60 THB). Also try Khao Soi Mae Sai near Chang Phueak Gate. You will eat this every single day in Chiang Mai and never get bored. 50-80 THB.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="tip-card fade-in">
            <div class="tip-card-icon">&#129380;</div>
            <h3 class="tip-card-title">Thai Iced Tea -- $0.50</h3>
            <p class="tip-card-text"><strong>The bright orange lifesaver.</strong> Strong black tea brewed with star anise, sweetened with condensed milk, and poured over ice. It's that unmistakable bright orange color you'll see everywhere. Sweet, creamy, refreshing, and the perfect antidote to Thailand's heat. Available at literally every food stall, 7-Eleven (bottled version), and restaurant in the country. Get the fresh-made version from street vendors -- they pour it back and forth between cups to froth it up. 15-25 THB.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="tip-card fade-in">
            <div class="tip-card-icon">&#127830;</div>
            <h3 class="tip-card-title">Moo Ping (Grilled Pork Skewers) -- $0.50 each</h3>
            <p class="tip-card-text"><strong>The best breakfast in Thailand.</strong> Marinated pork skewers grilled over charcoal and served with sticky rice and a sweet chili dipping sauce. Find them at morning markets starting at 6 AM -- look for the smoky charcoal grills. Thais eat 3-4 skewers with a bag of sticky rice for breakfast. Total cost: about 40-50 THB ($1.25) for a full meal. The pork is sweet, smoky, and slightly caramelized. Addictive doesn't begin to cover it. Chang Phueak Gate night market in Chiang Mai has incredible moo ping.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="tip-card fade-in">
            <div class="tip-card-icon">&#127834;</div>
            <h3 class="tip-card-title">Boat Noodles -- $1</h3>
            <p class="tip-card-text"><strong>Bangkok specialty, tiny bowls, massive flavor.</strong> Originally served from boats on Bangkok's canals, these intense pork or beef noodle soups come in tiny bowls -- the idea is to eat 3-5 of them. Each bowl is insanely flavorful with a dark, rich broth, tender meat, morning glory, and herbs. Victory Monument area in Bangkok has the best concentration of boat noodle shops. Bowls are just 12-15 THB each, so you stack them up. Locals compete to see how many they can eat. Your move.</p>

          <div class="tip-card fade-in">
            <div class="tip-card-icon">&#129360;</div>
            <h3 class="tip-card-title">Roti Pancakes -- $1</h3>
            <p class="tip-card-text"><strong>Dessert heaven.</strong> A crispy fried flatbread stuffed with banana and Nutella, drizzled with condensed milk, and cut into squares. The roti vendor stretches the dough paper-thin before frying it in butter on a flat griddle -- the technique is mesmerizing to watch. Available everywhere on the islands and in Bangkok's markets. The best roti vendors are usually Muslim Thai-Malay operators in southern Thailand (Koh Phangan, Koh Lanta, Krabi). Also try the egg roti with sugar for a simpler version. 30-50 THB.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="pro-tip fade-in">
          <div class="pro-tip-label">&#128161; Pro Tip -- Street Food Safety</div>
          <div class="pro-tip-text">Follow the locals. If a street cart has a line of Thai people, the food is fresh and safe. High turnover means nothing sits around. Avoid stalls with pre-made food sitting in the sun. Drink bottled water (7 THB at any 7-Eleven). And don't worry about "street food stomach" -- Thailand's street food hygiene is generally excellent. Most travelers who get sick ate at tourist restaurants, not street carts.</div>

          <p class="section-subtitle">Thailand has the best budget accommodation in Southeast Asia. From legendary backpacker streets to bamboo bungalows in the mountains, here's exactly where to sleep at every stop on your trip -- with real prices, real names, and real booking advice.</p>

              <div class="dest-card-price">$8 - $15/night</div>
              <p class="dest-card-text"><strong>The vibe:</strong> The legendary backpacker street. Khao San Road is ground zero for every backpacker passing through Southeast Asia. Cheap hostels stacked next to street food carts, tattoo parlors, tailor shops, and bars blasting music at all hours. It's loud, chaotic, and absolutely electric. You'll either love it or need earplugs.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-text"><strong>Top picks:</strong> NapPark Hostel (280-500 THB, pod-style beds, rooftop bar, consistently rated best hostel in Bangkok). Lub d Bangkok Siam (350-600 THB, near BTS, cleaner and quieter). Mad Monkey Bangkok (300-450 THB, party hostel with pool). For a step up, check guesthouses on Rambuttri Road -- same area, 30% quieter.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-text"><strong>Book on:</strong> Hostelworld or Booking.com. Book 1-2 weeks ahead for dorm beds, further ahead for private rooms.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-text"><strong>&#128161; Tip:</strong> If you want to actually sleep, stay on Soi Rambuttri (parallel street to Khao San) -- same walking distance to everything but significantly less noise after midnight.</p>

              <div class="dest-card-price">$10 - $20/night</div>
              <p class="dest-card-text"><strong>The vibe:</strong> Walking distance to ancient temples, night markets, and rooftop bars. Chiang Mai's Old City is surrounded by a moat and packed with centuries-old temples, cozy cafes, and some of the friendliest guesthouse owners in Thailand. The pace is slower than Bangkok and the prices are even cheaper.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-text"><strong>Top picks:</strong> Stamps Backpackers (250-400 THB, social atmosphere, free breakfast). Hug Hostel (280-450 THB, beautiful courtyard, great location). Julie Guesthouse (350-600 THB, long-running backpacker favorite near Tha Phae Gate). For digital nomads: CAMP at Maya Mall has free WiFi and amazing co-working vibes.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-text"><strong>Book on:</strong> Hostelworld, Booking.com, or just show up -- Chiang Mai rarely sells out except during Songkran (Thai New Year, mid-April) and Yi Peng Lantern Festival (November).</p>
              <p class="dest-card-text"><strong>&#128161; Tip:</strong> Stay inside the Old City moat for the best walkability. You can reach most temples, restaurants, and the Sunday Walking Street market on foot.</p>

              <div class="dest-card-price">$15 - $25/night (Full Moon week)</div>
              <p class="dest-card-text"><strong>The vibe:</strong> Beachfront bungalows and hostels steps from the Full Moon Party beach. During Full Moon week, Haad Rin transforms into a mini-city of backpackers. Prices triple during the party but it's worth staying close so you can walk home. The beach bars start their pre-party warm-up 2 days before the main event.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-text"><strong>Top picks:</strong> Slumber Party Hostel (400-1,200 THB depending on Full Moon dates, social hostel, pool, pre-party events). Same Same Hostel (350-1,000 THB, right on Haad Rin). Delight Resort (600-1,500 THB, private bungalows). For quiet: Haad Yao Bayview Resort (400-800 THB, 30 min from Haad Rin, beach bungalows).</p>
              <p class="dest-card-text"><strong>Book on:</strong> Hostelworld or Booking.com. BOOK AT LEAST 2 MONTHS AHEAD for Full Moon Party dates, especially December-January and peak season.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-text"><strong>&#128161; Tip:</strong> If you're on a tight budget, stay in Thong Sala (main pier town) and take a songthaew to Haad Rin on party night. Thong Sala is 50% cheaper and has a great night market.</p>

              <div class="dest-card-price">$200 - $300 (cert + 4 nights)</div>
              <p class="dest-card-text"><strong>The vibe:</strong> Dive schools double as accommodation. Koh Tao's genius business model: sign up for your PADI Open Water certification and get 3-4 nights of free or heavily discounted accommodation included. The dive schools compete for students, so packages are incredibly good value. You get a certification worth $500+ in the US for a fraction of the price, PLUS a place to sleep.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-text"><strong>Top picks:</strong> Ban's Diving Resort (PADI course 9,800 THB including 4 nights, Sairee Beach, biggest dive school on the island). Crystal Dive (9,500 THB package, excellent instructors). Big Blue Diving (9,000-10,000 THB, beachfront). For non-divers: Mr. J Hostel (250-400 THB, Sairee Beach) or Blue Wind hostel.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-text"><strong>Book on:</strong> Directly through dive school websites for the best package deals, or Hostelworld for standalone accommodation.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-text"><strong>&#128161; Tip:</strong> Even if you don't plan to dive, mention you're "considering it" when booking a hostel -- some places offer discounted rooms to potential diving students.</p>

              <div class="dest-card-price">$20 - $40/night</div>
              <p class="dest-card-text"><strong>The vibe:</strong> Railay Beach is only accessible by longtail boat and it shows -- no cars, no traffic, just dramatic limestone cliffs, crystal water, and a castaway atmosphere that feels a world away from everything. Worth the splurge for a beachfront hut where you fall asleep to the sound of waves.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-text"><strong>Top picks:</strong> Railay Garden View Resort (700-1,200 THB, budget option on Railay). Rapala Rock Wood Resort (800-1,500 THB, bungalows near the beach). Ao Nang: Pak-Up Hostel (350-500 THB, award-winning hostel in Krabi town). For rock climbing access, stay on Tonsai Beach -- basic bungalows from 400 THB with a climber community vibe.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-text"><strong>Book on:</strong> Booking.com for Railay (limited options on Hostelworld). Book ahead in peak season (Nov-Mar) as Railay has limited rooms.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-text"><strong>&#128161; Tip:</strong> Stay in Ao Nang (Krabi town) for cheaper rates and take the 15-minute longtail boat to Railay for day trips (150 THB each way). Best of both worlds.</p>

              <div class="dest-card-price">$8 - $12/night</div>
              <p class="dest-card-text"><strong>The vibe:</strong> The most chill place you will ever visit. Pai is a tiny hippie mountain town 3 hours north of Chiang Mai, nestled in a valley surrounded by rice paddies and misty green mountains. It's where backpackers come and accidentally stay for a week (or a month). Live music, yoga, hot springs, night markets, and bamboo bungalows with mountain views for the price of a coffee in New York.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-text"><strong>Top picks:</strong> Pai Village Boutique Resort Farm (300-500 THB, stunning rice paddy views). Pai Country Hut (250-400 THB, bamboo bungalows, hammocks, mountain views). Common Grounds (200-350 THB, social hostel, great cafe). For a splurge: Reverie Siam (1,200 THB, boutique colonial hotel with pool).</p>
              <p class="dest-card-text"><strong>Book on:</strong> Booking.com or just show up -- Pai has hundreds of bungalows and rarely sells out except during peak December/January holiday season.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-text"><strong>&#128161; Tip:</strong> The minivan from Chiang Mai to Pai (150 THB / $4.25, 3 hours) has 762 curves in the road. Take motion sickness pills before departure. Sit in the front. Trust us on this one.</p>

          <h2 class="section-title">Full Moon Party <span class="gradient-text">Survival Guide</span></h2>
          <p class="section-subtitle">The Full Moon Party is legendary for a reason -- and surviving it with your wallet, phone, and dignity intact requires a game plan. Here's everything you need to know before Haad Rin beach erupts.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="tips-grid">
          <div class="tip-card fade-in">
            <div class="tip-card-icon">&#128085;</div>
            <h3 class="tip-card-title">What to Wear</h3>
            <p class="tip-card-text">Neon is king. Wear a cheap tank top or swimwear you don't mind destroying -- they WILL get covered in paint, drinks, and sand. Buy UV-reactive body paint from stalls on Haad Rin for 50-100 THB. Wear cheap flip flops or old sneakers (the beach is littered with broken glass by midnight). Skip jewelry, watches, and anything you'd be sad to lose.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="tip-card fade-in">
            <div class="tip-card-icon">&#128737;</div>
            <h3 class="tip-card-title">Staying Safe</h3>
            <p class="tip-card-text">Bring only what you need: some cash (2,000-3,000 THB max), your room key, and your phone in a waterproof pouch. Leave your passport at the hostel safe. Stay with your group and set a meeting point in case you get separated. Avoid the ocean at night -- it's dark, currents are strong, and people get hurt every month. Stay away from the fire jump ropes if you've been drinking. Seriously.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="tip-card fade-in">
            <div class="tip-card-icon">&#127862;</div>
            <h3 class="tip-card-title">Bucket Drinks</h3>
            <p class="tip-card-text">The iconic Full Moon Party bucket: a small beach bucket filled with a spirit (Sang Som rum or Thai whiskey), mixer, Red Bull (the original Thai version), and ice. They cost 200-350 THB ($6-$10) depending on location. Buy from the beach bars, not random vendors. Share with friends. They're stronger than they taste. Pace yourself -- the party goes from sunset to sunrise and you want to make it to the end.</p>

          <div class="tip-card fade-in">
            <div class="tip-card-icon">&#128661;</div>
            <h3 class="tip-card-title">Getting There</h3>
            <p class="tip-card-text">If you're staying in Haad Rin, you can walk. From other parts of Koh Phangan, shared songthaews (covered pick-up trucks) run all night for 100-300 THB each way. Book your return ride in advance. Some hostels arrange group transport. The last ferry FROM the mainland arrives the afternoon before -- don't cut it close. Haad Rin fills up fast on party day.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="tip-card fade-in">
            <div class="tip-card-icon">&#127968;</div>
            <h3 class="tip-card-title">Where to Stay on Koh Phangan</h3>
            <p class="tip-card-text">Haad Rin is ground zero -- book early or pay triple. Budget: Slumber Party Hostel and Same Same Hostel (from 300 THB/night on normal days, 800-1,200 THB on Full Moon night). Mid-range: Haad Rin guesthouses. For quiet: Thong Nai Pan or Haad Yao beaches are 30-40 minutes away but way cheaper and you can actually sleep the night before. Book at least 2-3 weeks ahead.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="tip-card fade-in">
            <div class="tip-card-icon">&#127752;</div>
            <h3 class="tip-card-title">The After-Party Scene</h3>
            <p class="tip-card-text">The party doesn't end at sunrise -- it evolves. Half Moon Festival and Jungle Experience are massive mid-month parties in the jungle with world-class DJ lineups. Waterfall parties happen in actual waterfalls. And the "after-party" bars in Haad Rin (Mellow Mountain, Amsterdam Bar) keep going well into the next afternoon. Koh Phangan has a party for every night of the lunar cycle.</p>

          <p class="section-subtitle">Thailand is incredibly welcoming to visitors, but there are cultural norms you need to respect. Thai people are too polite to call you out, but they'll definitely notice. Learn these 6 rules and you'll earn genuine respect (and sometimes better prices) everywhere you go.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="tips-grid">
          <div class="tip-card fade-in">
            <div class="tip-card-icon">&#127981;</div>
            <h3 class="tip-card-title">Temple Dress Code</h3>
            <p class="tip-card-text">Cover your shoulders and knees at every temple -- no tank tops, shorts, or short skirts. This applies to everyone, regardless of gender. Most major temples (Wat Phra Kaew, Wat Pho, Doi Suthep) have free sarongs and cover-ups available at the entrance, but smaller temples may not. Carry a light scarf or sarong in your daypack. Remove shoes before entering any temple building -- you'll see rows of shoes outside. Hats off indoors too. It's not a suggestion, it's a strict requirement. Temples are active places of worship, not tourist attractions.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="tip-card fade-in">
            <div class="tip-card-icon">&#129462;</div>
            <h3 class="tip-card-title">The Head &amp; Feet Rule</h3>
            <p class="tip-card-text">In Thai culture, the head is the most sacred part of the body and the feet are the lowest and most disrespectful. Never touch anyone's head, not even a child's -- no playful head-rubs or hair-tousling. Never point your feet at a Buddha statue, a monk, or another person. When sitting on the floor in a temple, tuck your feet behind you or sit cross-legged. Don't step over someone who's sitting or lying down. And never, ever use your foot to point at something or stop a door. This is one of the most important cultural rules in Thailand.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="tip-card fade-in">
            <div class="tip-card-icon">&#128588;</div>
            <h3 class="tip-card-title">The Wai Greeting</h3>
            <p class="tip-card-text">The "wai" is Thailand's traditional greeting -- palms pressed together at chest level with a slight bow of the head. When someone wais you (hotel staff, restaurant servers, locals), return it. It shows respect and Thais genuinely appreciate when foreigners make the effort. The higher the hands, the more respect shown -- chest level for peers, nose level for elders, forehead level for monks and royalty. Don't wai to children or service staff who are younger than you -- a friendly smile and nod is appropriate. Never wai while holding objects.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="tip-card fade-in">
            <div class="tip-card-icon">&#128176;</div>
            <h3 class="tip-card-title">Haggling Rules</h3>
            <p class="tip-card-text">Haggling is expected and part of the fun at markets, street stalls, and tuk-tuk negotiations. Start at about 50% of the asking price and work toward a middle ground. Smile, be friendly, and keep it light -- aggressive haggling is considered rude and will backfire. If the vendor won't budge, walk away slowly -- they'll often call you back with a better price. But NEVER haggle at 7-Eleven, restaurants, fixed-price shops, or supermarkets. And don't haggle over tiny amounts -- fighting over 20 THB ($0.57) is a bad look when it means nothing to you but matters to the vendor.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="tip-card fade-in">
            <div class="tip-card-icon">&#128178;</div>
            <h3 class="tip-card-title">Tipping Culture</h3>
            <p class="tip-card-text">Tipping is not expected in Thailand the way it is in the US, but it's appreciated for good service. Round up taxi and Grab fares to the nearest 10 or 20 baht. Leave 20-50 THB at sit-down restaurants if the service was great (most restaurants don't add a service charge). For Thai massage, 50-100 THB tip is standard for a 1-hour session. Tour guides and boat drivers appreciate 100-200 THB. At street food stalls, tipping isn't expected at all. When in doubt, a small tip and a "khop khun krap/ka" (thank you) goes a long way.</p>

          <div class="tip-card fade-in">
            <div class="tip-card-icon">&#128081;</div>
            <h3 class="tip-card-title">Royal Family Respect</h3>
            <p class="tip-card-text">This is not optional -- Thailand's l&#232;se-majest&#233; laws are among the strictest in the world and they are actively enforced. Never make disrespectful comments about the Thai monarchy, the King, or any member of the royal family. This applies to spoken words, social media posts, and even casual jokes. Punishments include prison sentences of up to 15 years. Stand when the royal anthem plays before movies in cinemas (everyone does). Never step on Thai currency -- it has the King's image on it. This is a serious law, not a cultural suggestion. Respect it fully.</p>

          <p class="section-subtitle">Thailand's transport network is excellent, cheap, and part of the adventure. From $30 domestic flights to overnight buses with blankets to island ferries cutting through turquoise water -- here's how to move between every stop on your itinerary without breaking the bank.</p>
        </div>

              <div class="dest-card-badge">&#9992; Fastest</div>
              <h3 class="dest-card-title">Domestic Flights</h3>
              <div class="dest-card-price">$30 - $60 one way</div>
              <p class="dest-card-text"><strong>Airlines:</strong> AirAsia, Nok Air, Thai Lion Air, and Thai VietJet. All are budget carriers with no-frills service but perfectly safe and reliable. Book on Skyscanner or directly on airline websites for the best prices. Prices increase closer to departure, so book 2-4 weeks ahead.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-text"><strong>Key routes:</strong> Bangkok (DMK) to Chiang Mai (1 hr, from 1,100 THB / $31). Bangkok to Surat Thani (1 hr, from 900 THB / $25, gateway to Gulf islands). Bangkok to Krabi (1.5 hrs, from 1,200 THB / $34). Bangkok to Phuket (1.5 hrs, from 1,000 THB / $28). Chiang Mai to Surat Thani (from 1,200 THB / $34).</p>
              <p class="dest-card-text"><strong>&#128161; Tip:</strong> Fly into Bangkok (BKK or DMK), fly out of Krabi or Phuket. One-way tickets are cheap and it saves you backtracking to Bangkok at the end of your trip. AirAsia flies from Don Mueang (DMK), not Suvarnabhumi (BKK) -- don't go to the wrong airport. Budget airlines charge for checked bags, so pack carry-on only (7kg) to save 400-800 THB per flight.</p>

              <div class="dest-card-price">$15 - $25 one way</div>
              <p class="dest-card-text"><strong>VIP buses:</strong> Thailand's VIP overnight buses are surprisingly comfortable -- reclining seats, blankets, pillows, a snack box, and sometimes on-board entertainment. Bangkok to Chiang Mai is about 10 hours overnight (500-800 THB / $14-$23). Bangkok to Surat Thani (gateway to islands) is 9 hours (400-700 THB / $11-$20). Book through 12Go.Asia or at any travel agency.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-text"><strong>Sleeper trains:</strong> The overnight train from Bangkok to Chiang Mai is a backpacker rite of passage. Second-class lower berth costs 791 THB ($22) -- you get a fold-down bed, clean sheets, and air conditioning. The train rocks gently through the Thai countryside and you wake up in Chiang Mai. Book at Hua Lamphong station or through 12Go.Asia up to 60 days ahead.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-text"><strong>&#128161; Tip:</strong> Overnight transport saves you a night of accommodation. Bangkok to Chiang Mai by sleeper train costs $22 and replaces a $10 hostel night -- so the real cost is only $12 for the journey. Always choose "VIP" or "first class" buses -- the extra $5 is worth it for the legroom and reclining seats.</p>

              <p class="dest-card-text"><strong>Songthaews:</strong> Red covered pick-up trucks that function as shared taxis. In Chiang Mai, flag one down and tell the driver your destination -- 30-50 THB ($1-$1.50) per person for rides within the Old City. On the islands, they're the main transport between beaches (100-300 THB depending on distance). They run set routes but will also do private charters.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-text"><strong>Tuk-tuks:</strong> The iconic three-wheeled vehicles. Fun for the experience but more expensive than other options -- 100-200 THB ($3-$6) for short rides in Bangkok or Chiang Mai. ALWAYS agree on the price BEFORE getting in. If a driver quotes way too much, laugh, counter-offer, or just walk to the next one. In Bangkok, the Grab app (Southeast Asia's Uber) is usually cheaper and metered.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-text"><strong>&#128161; Tip:</strong> Download the Grab app before arriving in Thailand. It works like Uber with transparent pricing -- no haggling required. Available in Bangkok, Chiang Mai, Phuket, and most cities. GrabBike (motorcycle taxi) is the fastest and cheapest option in Bangkok traffic. Also works for food delivery.</p>

              <p class="dest-card-text"><strong>Lomprayah:</strong> The most popular catamaran company connecting the Gulf islands. High-speed catamaran service between Koh Samui, Koh Phangan, and Koh Tao (300-700 THB / $9-$20 per leg, 1-2 hours). Air-conditioned cabin, clean, reliable. Book on Lomprayah.com or 12Go.Asia. They also sell combined bus + ferry tickets from Bangkok all the way to the islands (from 1,000 THB / $28).</p>
              <p class="dest-card-text"><strong>Seatran Discovery:</strong> Another reliable ferry company on the Gulf route. Slightly cheaper than Lomprayah, slightly slower. Both are good options. For the Andaman side (Phuket, Phi Phi, Krabi, Lanta), Tigerline and Andaman Wave Master run regular services.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-text"><strong>&#128161; Tip:</strong> Book combo bus + ferry tickets from Bangkok directly to your island destination. A single ticket covers the overnight bus from Bangkok to Surat Thani PLUS the morning ferry to Koh Phangan or Koh Tao -- seamless connection, one booking, and they handle the transfers. Available through 12Go.Asia or any travel agency on Khao San Road. Saves both money and planning headaches.</p>

              <p>Thailand is one of the safest countries in Southeast Asia for solo travelers, including college students. It consistently ranks among the top backpacker destinations worldwide. Basic precautions apply: avoid walking alone late at night in isolated areas, keep valuables secure, be cautious with bucket drinks at parties, and use reputable transport. Thai people are famously friendly and helpful. The tourist infrastructure is excellent with English widely spoken in tourist areas. Millions of solo backpackers visit Thailand safely every year.</p>

              <p>No vaccinations are legally required to enter Thailand for US citizens, but the CDC recommends several: Hepatitis A and B, Typhoid, and routine vaccinations should be up to date. If you plan to visit rural areas or do jungle trekking, Japanese Encephalitis and Rabies vaccines may be recommended. Malaria prophylaxis is not needed for major tourist areas like Bangkok, Chiang Mai, and the southern islands but may be advised for border regions.

              <p>Thailand is incredibly affordable for college students. You can genuinely live well on $30-$50 USD per day. Street food meals cost 40-80 THB ($1-2 USD), a hostel dorm bed runs 200-400 THB ($6-12 USD), local transport is cheap (Bangkok BTS is 16-59 THB), and a Thai massage costs 200-300 THB ($6-9 USD). Even nicer restaurants rarely exceed $5-10. Beer is $1.50-3, and cocktail buckets at Full Moon Party run 200-350 THB ($6-10). The biggest expense is your international flight.</p>

              <p>The best Thai islands for college students are: Koh Phangan (home of the Full Moon Party, great beaches, affordable), Koh Tao (best diving in Thailand, tiny island, backpacker community), Koh Samui (more upscale but still affordable areas, great nightlife in Chaweng), Koh Phi Phi (stunning Maya Bay from The Beach movie, party atmosphere), Koh Lanta (chill vibes, cheaper, great for relaxing), and Koh Lipe (remote paradise near Malaysia). For the Full Moon Party route, the Koh Phangan to Koh Tao to Koh Samui triangle is the classic student island-hopping circuit.</p>

              <p>Absolutely. English is widely spoken in all major tourist areas including Bangkok, Chiang Mai, Phuket, and the popular islands. Hotel staff, tour operators, restaurant workers, and taxi drivers in tourist zones communicate in English. Signs and menus in tourist areas are bilingual. However, learning a few Thai phrases goes a long way: "Sawadee krap/ka" (hello), "Khop khun krap/ka" (thank you), and "Tao rai?" (how much?) will earn you smiles and sometimes better prices. Google Translate works offline if you download the Thai language pack.</p>

            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>Thailand's monsoon season varies by region. The southwest monsoon affects the west coast (Phuket, Krabi, Koh Lanta) from May to October. The east coast Gulf islands (Koh Phangan, Koh Tao, Koh Samui) get their heaviest rain from October to December. Bangkok and Chiang Mai see the most rain from June to October. The best overall window is November to April when most of the country is dry and sunny. However, even during monsoon season, rain usually comes in short afternoon bursts -- you can still enjoy your trip. Prices drop significantly during the wet season.</p>

              <p>Pack light -- you can buy almost anything cheaply in Thailand. Essentials: lightweight breathable clothes (4-5 outfits max), swimsuit, reef-safe sunscreen, insect repellent (DEET-based), flip flops and one pair of walking shoes, a cover-up for temple visits (shoulders and knees must be covered), waterproof phone pouch (essential for Full Moon Party), quick-dry towel, basic first aid kit, padlock for hostel lockers, power adapter (Type A/B/C outlets), and a headlamp. Keep your backpack under 40L -- you will be moving between islands and overpacking is the number one rookie mistake.</p>

              <p>The Full Moon Party happens every full moon, typically one night per month on Haad Rin beach, Koh Phangan. Here are the 2026 dates: January 13, February 12, March 14, April 12, May 12, June 11, July 10, August 9, September 7, October 7, November 5, and December 5. Note that the actual party date is sometimes shifted by a day if the full moon falls on a major Buddhist holiday (when alcohol sales are banned). Half Moon parties and Black Moon parties also happen on Koh Phangan throughout the month -- the Half Moon Festival is a jungle rave held at a dedicated venue in Baan Tai, and many travelers say it's even better than the Full Moon Party itself. Check the official Koh Phangan calendar before booking.</p>

              <p>US, UK, and EU citizens get 30 days visa-free on arrival in Thailand -- just show up at the airport with a passport valid for at least 6 months and a return or onward flight booking. For stays up to 60 days, apply for a Tourist Visa (TR) at a Thai embassy or consulate before departure (costs $40 / 1,400 THB). You can also extend any visa by 30 additional days at a Thai immigration office for 1,900 THB ($55) -- the Koh Samui and Koh Phangan immigration offices are relatively quick and painless. Australian and Canadian citizens also get 30 days visa-free. For most 2-3 week college trips, you won't need a visa at all -- the 30-day exemption covers it.</p>

              <p>Yes, Thailand is consistently rated one of the safest countries in Southeast Asia for solo female travelers. Millions of women backpack through Thailand every year without incident. That said, standard precautions apply everywhere: watch your drinks at parties (especially at Full Moon Party -- never leave a drink unattended), use registered taxis or the Grab app instead of unmarked vehicles late at night, avoid isolated areas after dark, and trust your instincts. Thai people, especially women, are incredibly warm and helpful. Hostels are great places to meet other solo female travelers to buddy up with. Many women report feeling safer solo in Thailand than in major US or European cities.</p>

              <p>Thailand runs mostly on cash, especially at markets, street food stalls, and on the islands. ATMs are everywhere (even tiny Koh Tao has them) but charge a flat 220 THB ($6.30) foreign transaction fee per withdrawal, so always withdraw the maximum amount each time (usually 20,000-30,000 THB) to minimize fees. Wise (formerly TransferWise) and Revolut debit cards offer the best exchange rates and lowest fees -- set one up before your trip. Bangkok has excellent exchange booths (SuperRich is the best) that beat airport rates significantly. Credit cards are accepted at hotels, nicer restaurants, and malls, but not at street food stalls, markets, or small shops. Keep small bills (20 and 50 THB notes) for songthaews and street food. Cash is king at markets -- you can't haggle with a credit card.</p>

              <p>The CDC recommends Hepatitis A and B, Typhoid, and all routine vaccinations (MMR, Tetanus, etc.) for travel to Thailand. Hepatitis A is the most important -- it's spread through contaminated food and water. Typhoid is recommended if you'll be eating street food extensively (you will). Malaria pills are only needed for remote jungle border areas near Myanmar and Cambodia -- not for Bangkok, Chiang Mai, the islands, or any standard tourist route. Japanese Encephalitis vaccine may be recommended for extended rural stays. Visit a travel clinic 4-6 weeks before departure to allow time for vaccine courses. Most college health centers offer travel consultations. Bring basic medications: anti-diarrheal (Imodium), rehydration salts, antihistamines, and any personal prescriptions. Thai pharmacies sell most medications over the counter for cheap, but bring your essentials from home.</p>

              <p>Absolutely -- and we highly recommend it if you have the time. Southeast Asia is incredibly well-connected with cheap flights. Bangkok to Siem Reap, Cambodia (for Angkor Wat) is about $30-40 on AirAsia (1 hour flight). Bangkok to Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam is $40-50 (2 hours). Many backpackers combine Thailand + Cambodia + Vietnam into a 4-6 week mega-trip that covers the highlights of all three countries for under $3,000 total. Cambodia e-visa is available online for $36 (takes 3 business days, apply before departure). Vietnam e-visa is $25 online. You can also do overland border crossings: bus from Bangkok to Siem Reap ($20-25, 8 hours) or Bangkok to Vientiane, Laos ($25, overnight bus). The Bangkok-Siem Reap bus route is the most popular add-on for students with an extra 3-4 days.</p>
