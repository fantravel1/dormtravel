          "text": "Snowboarding is generally slightly cheaper for beginners because rental packages tend to cost $5-$10 less per day, and snowboard lessons are sometimes shorter since many students pick up the basics faster. However, the difference is minimal. A full ski rental package (skis, boots, poles) runs about $35-$55/day, while a snowboard package (board, boots) is $30-$50/day. The real cost difference comes from your multi-day pass and lodging, not the equipment choice. Choose whichever sport interests you more -- the savings either way are negligible."

Breckenridge also offers fantastic beginner terrain at Peak 9 and Peak 8 base area with plenty of green runs. Both resorts have magic carpet lifts and bunny hills. Copper Mountain is another great option with naturally separated terrain -- beginners on the west side, experts on the east -- so you won't accidentally end up on a difficult run."

The Ikon Pass covers Copper Mountain, Winter Park, Arapahoe Basin, and Eldora. For a college ski trip, the Epic Day Pass lets you buy 1-7 days at a steep discount versus window rates (often 30-50% off). You can also save by buying lift tickets on Liftopia or the resort's website at least 7 days in advance. College students can sometimes get discounted season passes -- check each resort for student pricing, which can be 20-30% off."

Symptoms include headache, nausea, fatigue, and shortness of breath. Prevention tips: drink lots of water (double your normal intake), avoid alcohol for the first 24 hours, take it easy on day one, eat carb-heavy meals, and consider arriving in Denver a day early to start acclimatizing at 5,280 feet. Over-the-counter remedies like ibuprofen can help with headaches. If symptoms are severe, descend to a lower elevation immediately."

For the best deals, book 2-3 months in advance, search for properties that sleep 8-12 to split costs, and look for places with a kitchen to save on food.

You need either snow tires, tires with the M+S designation, or chains/AutoSocks. If you're renting a car from Denver, request an AWD or 4WD vehicle with all-season tires at minimum. Many rental companies at Denver International Airport offer SUVs with appropriate tires. Alternatively, skip driving entirely and take the Bustang or Colorado Mountain Express shuttle from Denver to Breckenridge (about $25-$65 one way), which avoids I-70 traffic and the stress of mountain driving."

Do NOT pack jeans to ski in, cotton socks, or a heavy winter coat as your ski jacket -- you'll overheat."

          <p class="section-subtitle">From hot tub time travel to one-in-a-million chances in Aspen, Hollywood has been obsessed with the college ski trip for decades. These are the films that turned a winter vacation into a cultural phenomenon.</p>
        </div>

            <h3 class="tip-card-title">Hot Tub Time Machine (2010)</h3>
            <p class="tip-card-text">The movie that defined the modern college ski trip. John Cusack and friends return to a ski resort and accidentally travel back to the 1980s via a malfunctioning hot tub. It's absurd, hilarious, and somehow captures the exact energy of cramming too many friends into a cabin and letting chaos unfold. The hot tub scene is basically a documentary of every college ski trip hot tub moment.</p>

            <h3 class="tip-card-title">Aspen Extreme (1993)</h3>
            <p class="tip-card-text">Two Detroit auto workers move to Aspen to become ski instructors and live the dream. This cult classic captures the magnetic pull of Colorado's ski towns -- the powder, the nightlife, the lifestyle. It's the movie that made an entire generation think about dropping everything and heading to the mountains. The ski footage alone is worth the watch, shot on location at Aspen and Buttermilk.</p>

            <p class="tip-card-text">"So you're telling me there's a chance!" Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels road trip to Aspen, Colorado in one of the greatest comedies ever made. The Aspen scenes -- from the ski lodge to the charity ball -- turned this Colorado ski town into a pop culture landmark. Every group ski trip has at least one person who quotes this movie the entire time, and honestly, that's part of the charm.</p>

            <p class="tip-card-text">An underrated gem about a group of snowboarders trying to save their local mountain from a corporate takeover. It's basically a love letter to snowboard culture with Jackass-style humor and a killer soundtrack. If your crew is more into boarding than skiing, this is the pre-trip movie night pick. The party scenes are aspirational for any college snow trip.</p>

            <p class="tip-card-text">While Disney's Frozen isn't about skiing, it cemented the "ice and snow" aesthetic into pop culture in a way that made winter trips even cooler. Beyond that, the broader ski culture -- from Warren Miller films to YouTube ski edits with millions of views -- has turned mountain culture into a lifestyle brand. The GoPro footage, the drone shots, the apres-ski content -- it all feeds into why the college ski trip is a must-do.</p>

          <h2 class="section-title">Why Colorado Is the <span class="gradient-text">Ultimate College Ski Destination</span></h2>
          <p class="section-subtitle">There's a reason Colorado gets more college ski trips than anywhere else in the country. The combination of legendary snow, affordable group lodging, and unbeatable apres-ski makes it the clear winner. Here's the breakdown.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="tips-grid">

            <div class="tip-card-icon">&#10052;&#65039;</div>
            <h3 class="tip-card-title">World-Class Powder</h3>
            <p class="tip-card-text">Colorado averages over 300 inches of snowfall per year at its major resorts. The high altitude means lighter, drier powder than what you'll find in the Northeast or Pacific Northwest -- the kind of snow that makes even intermediate skiers feel like pros. Breckenridge alone has over 2,900 acres of skiable terrain across five peaks. When people talk about "champagne powder," they're talking about Colorado.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="tip-card fade-in">
            <div class="tip-card-icon">&#127968;</div>
            <h3 class="tip-card-title">Cabin Splitting Makes It Cheap</h3>
            <p class="tip-card-text">Here's the secret to an affordable ski trip: rent a big cabin and split it 6-8 ways. A 4-bedroom cabin in Breckenridge runs about $250-$500/night on Vrbo or Airbnb. Split 8 ways, that's $30-$65 per person per night -- cheaper than most hotels and infinitely more fun. You get a full kitchen (cook breakfast and dinner in, save hundreds), a living room for hangouts, and almost always a hot tub. The cabin IS the experience.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="tip-card fade-in">
            <div class="tip-card-icon">&#127866;</div>
            <h3 class="tip-card-title">Epic Apres-Ski Scene</h3>
            <p class="tip-card-text">Colorado's apres-ski scene is unmatched. In Breckenridge, hit up the Breckenridge Brewery for craft beers and hearty food, or grab a seat at Quandary Grill right on Main Street. The T-Bar at the base of Peak 9 is a classic after-a-day-on-the-mountain spot. In Vail, the Red Lion and Garfinkel's are legendary. The vibe is boots-on, jacket-off, everyone-is-best-friends energy. It's the reward after a hard day on the slopes.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="tip-card fade-in">
            <div class="tip-card-icon">&#128154;</div>
            <h3 class="tip-card-title">Beginner-Friendly Mountains</h3>
            <p class="tip-card-text">Never skied before? No problem. Colorado resorts are built for first-timers. Keystone's Dercum Mountain has wide, gentle green runs perfect for learning. Breckenridge's Peak 9 base area is a beginner's paradise with magic carpet lifts and patient instructors. Most resorts offer first-timer lesson packages that include a lift ticket, rental, and group lesson for $150-$200. Half your friend group has probably never skied either, so you'll be learning together.</p>

            <div class="tip-card-icon">&#9832;</div>
            <h3 class="tip-card-title">Hot Tubs Are Included</h3>
            <p class="tip-card-text">Nearly every cabin rental in Summit County comes with a private hot tub on the deck. After a full day of skiing, there is nothing -- absolutely nothing -- better than sinking into a steaming hot tub with mountain views and a cold drink. It's the quintessential college ski trip moment. The Hot Tub Time Machine didn't make this up; the hot tub has been central to ski trip culture since forever. It's where the best conversations happen.</p>

            <div class="tip-card-icon">&#9992;</div>
            <h3 class="tip-card-title">Easy to Fly Into Denver</h3>
            <p class="tip-card-text">Denver International Airport (DEN) is one of the busiest airports in the US with direct flights from nearly every major city. Budget airlines like Frontier and Southwest frequently run deals under $150 roundtrip. From DEN, it's a 90-minute drive on I-70 to Breckenridge, Keystone, and the Summit County resorts. You can also take the Bustang bus for about $25 one way. No tiny regional airport hassle -- just land, rent a car (or shuttle), and you're on the mountain in under two hours.</p>

              <h3 class="dest-card-title">&#127969; Airbnb Cabin in Silverthorne</h3>
              <p class="dest-card-subtitle">$150 - $250/night &bull; Fits 6-8 guests</p>
              <p class="dest-card-desc"><strong>The Setup:</strong> A standalone cabin or townhome in Silverthorne, about 15 minutes from both Keystone and Breckenridge. Most have 3-4 bedrooms, a full kitchen, living room with fireplace, and the crown jewel -- a private hot tub on the deck. Split 8 ways, you're looking at $20-$30 per person per night. That's cheaper than a hostel in most cities.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-desc"><strong>Why It Works:</strong> The full kitchen alone saves your group $40-$60 per person per day versus eating out. Cook breakfast and dinner in, pack lunches for the mountain, and redirect those savings toward lift tickets and apres-ski. The hot tub is included in the rental, and the living room becomes your group's home base for card games, movie nights, and trip planning.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-desc"><strong>Distance to Slopes:</strong> 15 minutes to Keystone, 20 minutes to Breckenridge, 25 minutes to A-Basin. You'll need a car, but the drive through Summit County is gorgeous and the roads are well-maintained.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-desc"><strong>Best Feature:</strong> The hot tub under the stars at 9,000ft elevation. After a full day of skiing, this is the defining moment of the trip. Bring your own drinks, cue up a playlist, and just exist.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-desc"><strong>Booking Tip:</strong> Book on Airbnb 2-3 months in advance for the best selection. Filter for "hot tub" and "kitchen" -- these are non-negotiable. Read the last 10 reviews for accuracy. Check if the listing includes parking and Wi-Fi. Avoid listings with excessive cleaning fees that push the total above comparable options on Vrbo.</p>

              <p class="dest-card-subtitle">$100 - $200/night &bull; Condos at resort bases</p>
              <p class="dest-card-desc"><strong>The Setup:</strong> Professionally managed condos and townhomes at the base of Summit County resorts. These are typically 2-3 bedroom units in complexes with shared amenities like pools, hot tubs, fitness centers, and sometimes shuttle service. Book through VRBO, Vacasa, or direct through resort lodging portals like Breckenridge Grand Vacations or Keystone Resort Lodging.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-desc"><strong>Why It Works:</strong> Ski-in/ski-out options exist at this price range, which means you can literally walk out the door and onto the lift. No car needed on ski days, no hunting for parking, no shuttle waiting. The convenience premium pays for itself in time saved and stress avoided. Shared complex amenities like heated pools and community hot tubs are a bonus.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-desc"><strong>Distance to Slopes:</strong> 0-5 minutes if you book a slope-side condo. River Run Village at Keystone and the Village at Breckenridge both have walkable units right at the base.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-desc"><strong>Best Feature:</strong> Ski-in/ski-out access. Roll out of bed, gear up, and be on the first chair. No driving, no parking hassle, no warming up a cold car at 7 AM.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-desc"><strong>Booking Tip:</strong> Vacasa properties tend to have the most consistent quality since they're professionally managed. VRBO is excellent for filtering by group size and amenities. Book through resort lodging portals if you want to bundle with lift ticket discounts -- Keystone especially offers lodging + lift packages that save 15-20%.</p>

              <p class="dest-card-subtitle">$40 - $60/night &bull; Dorms + private rooms</p>
              <p class="dest-card-desc"><strong>The Setup:</strong> The Fireside Inn is Breckenridge's beloved hostel -- a cozy, lodge-style building with both dorm beds and private rooms. Dorm beds run $40-$50/night and private rooms are $90-$130/night. The communal kitchen is fully equipped, there's a living room with a fireplace, and the social atmosphere means you'll meet other skiers and travelers from around the world.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-desc"><strong>Why It Works:</strong> If your group is smaller (2-4 people) and a cabin doesn't make financial sense, the Fireside Inn is the move. It's walking distance to the Breckenridge lifts and Main Street, so you don't need a car once you're there. The communal vibe is perfect for solo travelers or small groups who want to meet people. The kitchen saves money just like a cabin would.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-desc"><strong>Distance to Slopes:</strong> Walking distance -- about 10 minutes on foot to the BreckConnect Gondola, which takes you to the base of Peak 7 and Peak 8. No car or shuttle needed.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-desc"><strong>Best Feature:</strong> The social atmosphere. You'll end up making friends with other college groups, sharing ride splits, and getting tips from regulars who know the mountain inside out. The fireplace common area is the ultimate post-ski hangout.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-desc"><strong>Booking Tip:</strong> Book directly through the Fireside Inn website for the best rates. Dorm beds sell out fast during peak season (MLK weekend, Presidents' Day, Spring Break), so reserve 4-6 weeks ahead. Ask about their multi-night discount -- stays of 3+ nights sometimes get 10% off.</p>

              <p class="dest-card-subtitle">$70 - $100/night &bull; Split a double queen 4 ways</p>
              <p class="dest-card-desc"><strong>The Setup:</strong> Frisco is a small, charming town right in the center of Summit County. Budget motels like the Motel 6 Frisco, Holiday Inn Frisco, or the Baymont by Wyndham offer double queen rooms for $70-$100/night. Split a room 4 ways and you're paying $18-$25 per person per night. It's basic, but it's clean, warm, and has everything you need -- a bed, a shower, and sometimes a complimentary breakfast.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-desc"><strong>Why It Works:</strong> Frisco's central location means you're within 15-20 minutes of five major resorts: Breckenridge, Keystone, A-Basin, Copper Mountain, and Vail. The free Summit Stage bus system connects Frisco to all of these resorts, so you might not even need a car on ski days. There are solid restaurants and a small downtown area with grocery stores.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-desc"><strong>Distance to Slopes:</strong> 10 minutes to Copper Mountain, 15 minutes to Breckenridge, 15 minutes to Keystone, 20 minutes to A-Basin, 30 minutes to Vail. All accessible via free Summit Stage shuttle.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-desc"><strong>Best Feature:</strong> The free Summit Stage bus. It runs from early morning to late evening, stops at every resort, and means you don't have to deal with parking ($20-$30/day at most resorts) or driving on icy roads after a long day of skiing.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-desc"><strong>Booking Tip:</strong> Book direct on the hotel's website or through Priceline for the best rates. Avoid booking during MLK weekend or Presidents' Day week -- prices spike 40-60%. If you're flexible, midweek arrivals (Tuesday-Thursday) are significantly cheaper than Friday-Saturday.</p>

              <p class="dest-card-subtitle">$120 - $180/night &bull; Slope-side convenience</p>
              <p class="dest-card-desc"><strong>The Setup:</strong> The Keystone Lodge sits right in River Run Village at the base of Keystone Resort. You get slope-side access, heated outdoor pools, hot tubs, a fitness center, and the convenience of being steps from restaurants, shops, and the gondola. Rooms range from standard hotel rooms to suites that can fit 4-6 people. Split a suite 4 ways and you're at $30-$45 per person per night.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-desc"><strong>Why It Works:</strong> Convenience is the premium here, and it's worth it if you value time on the mountain over saving $15/night. Wake up, walk 2 minutes to the lift, ski all day, walk back. No car, no shuttle, no frostbitten wait at a bus stop. The heated pool and hot tubs are shared with other guests, which means a bigger social scene than a private cabin.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-desc"><strong>Distance to Slopes:</strong> Steps. Literally steps. The River Run Gondola is a 2-minute walk from the lodge entrance. This is as close to ski-in/ski-out as you can get without a condo.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-desc"><strong>Best Feature:</strong> The heated outdoor pools and hot tubs with mountain views. After skiing, soak in the pool area surrounded by snow-covered peaks. It's a resort experience at a fraction of Vail prices.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-desc"><strong>Booking Tip:</strong> Book through the Epic Pass portal if you have an Epic Pass -- they often offer 20-30% lodging discounts for passholders. Check for "stay and ski" packages that bundle lift tickets with lodging. Midweek stays (Sunday-Thursday) are 25-35% cheaper than weekend rates.</p>

              <p class="dest-card-subtitle">$0 in summer &bull; The hardcore option</p>
              <p class="dest-card-desc"><strong>The Setup:</strong> National Forest land surrounds every resort in Summit County, and dispersed camping is free on most of it. In winter? This is genuinely not recommended unless you have serious cold-weather camping experience. Nighttime temps regularly drop to -10&#176;F and you need a 4-season tent, a -20&#176;F sleeping bag, and the kind of commitment to budget travel that borders on masochism.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-desc"><strong>Why It Actually Works (In May):</strong> Here's the secret: spring skiing at A-Basin runs through May and sometimes into June. May temps in Summit County are 30-50&#176;F during the day. Car camping at a dispersed site off Swan Mountain Road or near Dillon Reservoir is completely doable with basic gear. Ski all day at A-Basin ($95 lift ticket), come back to your campsite, cook on a camp stove, and sleep in your car or tent. Total trip cost: almost nothing.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-desc"><strong>Distance to Slopes:</strong> Varies wildly -- dispersed sites near Dillon Reservoir are 15-25 minutes from A-Basin and Keystone. Swan Mountain Road sites are 10 minutes from Breckenridge.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-desc"><strong>Best Feature:</strong> It's free. Zero dollars for lodging. If you're a broke college student who loves the outdoors, spring skiing + car camping is the ultimate budget hack. Plus, falling asleep under stars at 9,000ft after a day of spring skiing is an experience money can't buy.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-desc"><strong>Booking Tip:</strong> No booking needed -- that's the beauty of dispersed camping. Just follow Leave No Trace principles, camp at least 100ft from water sources, and check the USFS White River National Forest website for any closures. Bring a camp stove (no campfires during some months), a good sleeping pad, and layers. The Walmart in Silverthorne has cheap camping supplies if you forgot something.</p>

          <p>The sweet spot for most college groups is an Airbnb cabin in Silverthorne or Frisco with 6-8 people. You get the hot tub, the kitchen, the group living room experience, and your per-person cost stays under $30/night. Book 2-3 months ahead during peak season. If your group is smaller (2-4 people), the Fireside Inn hostel in Breckenridge is the best value with walking distance to lifts and a social atmosphere that can't be beat.</p>

                  <span class="itinerary-time">Morning/Afternoon</span>
                  <p>Land at Denver International Airport (DEN). Pick up your rental car -- book an SUV or AWD vehicle. Pro tip: have one person coordinate the rental while others grab bags. Stop at King Soopers or Walmart in Silverthorne on I-70 for a massive grocery run. Buy breakfast food, snacks, pasta, sauce, sandwich stuff, drinks, and hot tub beverages. Cooking in the cabin saves you $40-$60/person/day versus eating out for every meal.</p>

                  <p>Arrive at your cabin in Breckenridge (about 90 minutes from Denver, depending on I-70 traffic). Assign rooms, unload groceries, explore the cabin. Most cabins have a full kitchen, multiple bathrooms, a living room with a fireplace, and the crown jewel -- the hot tub out back. Take a walk around the neighborhood and get oriented.</p>

                  <p>First night cabin hangout. Cook a big group dinner -- pasta is the classic move. Everyone is tired from travel, so keep it chill. Fire up the hot tub for the first time, break out the card games or connect a Bluetooth speaker. This is where the trip starts. Acclimatize to the altitude (9,600 feet!) by drinking lots of water and taking it easy. Avoid heavy drinking tonight -- altitude amplifies everything and you want to feel good for tomorrow's first day on the mountain.</p>

                  <p>Big cabin breakfast -- eggs, bacon, toast, coffee. Pick up your ski or snowboard rentals if you didn't do it the night before. Head to the Breckenridge base area. Beginners should book a morning group lesson at the ski school on Peak 9 ($150-$200 including lift ticket and rental). Intermediate and advanced skiers can head straight to the BreckConnect Gondola from town and start exploring.</p>

Grab lunch at one of the on-mountain lodges -- the Ten Mile Station at the top of the gondola has great views and decent food (budget $15-$20 for lunch). Or save money by packing PB&amp;J sandwiches and granola bars in your jacket pockets.</p>

The T-Bar at the base of Peak 9 is the classic Breck apres spot -- outdoor seating, live music, and everyone still in their ski boots. Walk down Main Street to Breckenridge Brewery for craft beers and loaded nachos, or grab a table at Quandary Grill for burgers and cocktails. Head back to the cabin, hot tub round two, and cook dinner. You've earned it.</p>

Advanced skiers should explore the Peak 6 bowls or the Imperial Express Superchair -- the highest chairlift in North America at 12,840 feet. The terrain up there is gnarly and the views are insane. Intermediate skiers who progressed from yesterday can start tackling blue-black runs on Peak 8.</p>

Even if you've never hit a park feature, the small jumps are approachable and incredibly fun. Grab lunch at the Overlook Bar &amp; Grill at Peak 9 or bring cabin leftovers in your pack.

Walk the art district, check out the shops, and soak in the mountain town vibe. This is the big night out of the trip.</p>

Keystone has excellent grooming, a fun village, and if you're staying through the evening, it offers night skiing on select days until 8:00 PM -- a totally different experience skiing under the lights. Option B: Drive 30 minutes to Arapahoe Basin (A-Basin) for a more rugged, old-school mountain experience. A-Basin is where locals go -- no frills, amazing terrain, and the legendary 6th Alley bar at the base.</p>

                  <p>Early wake-up for the last morning. Quick breakfast, pack your bags, and load the car. Check the cabin for chargers, goggles, and that one person's glove that always goes missing. Do a final clean-up (most Vrbo/Airbnb rentals require basic tidying). Head to the mountain for a half day of skiing. Make the most of those last runs -- hit your favorite trails one more time. Lifts open at 8:30 AM and you want to ski until at least noon.</p>

                  <p>Return your rental equipment (drop it off at the shop by 1:00 PM to avoid late fees). Hit the road back to Denver on I-70. Important: leave by 1:00 PM to avoid the brutal Sunday afternoon I-70 eastbound traffic through the Eisenhower Tunnel. This is not a suggestion -- I-70 traffic on weekend afternoons can add 2-3 hours to a normally 90-minute drive. If you can, leave even earlier.</p>

Head to the RiNo Art District for craft breweries and food halls, or hit up a classic Denver spot like Snooze for brunch or Illegal Pete's for massive burritos. Return the rental car, head to DEN, and fly home with a phone full of mountain photos and a group chat full of inside jokes. Start the "when are we doing this again?" conversation before you even board the plane.</p>

          <p class="section-subtitle">Colorado has over a dozen world-class ski resorts within 2 hours of Denver. Here are the six best options for college groups, with honest takes on who each one is best for. Most groups pick one "home base" resort and do a day trip to a second.</p>
        </div>

          <div class="tip-card fade-in">
            <div class="tip-card-icon">&#11088;</div>
            <h3 class="tip-card-title">Breckenridge</h3>
            <p class="tip-card-text">The all-around best choice for college groups. Five peaks, 2,900+ acres, incredible town with walkable Main Street packed with bars, restaurants, and shops. Terrain for every level from first-timers to experts. The apres-ski scene at Breckenridge Brewery and the T-Bar is legendary. Cabin rentals are plentiful and reasonably priced. On the Epic Pass. The only downside: it can get crowded on peak weekends. Go midweek if you can.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="tip-card fade-in">
            <div class="tip-card-icon">&#127769;</div>
            <h3 class="tip-card-title">Keystone</h3>
            <p class="tip-card-text">Keystone's secret weapon is night skiing -- on select dates, they keep the lights on until 8:00 PM, which means more runs per day. The resort has three mountains connected by lifts, excellent beginner terrain at Dercum Mountain, and a fun tubing hill. Lift tickets tend to be cheaper than Breck, and lodging in the River Run Village is convenient. Also on the Epic Pass. Great for groups with a mix of skill levels, and the night skiing alone makes it worth a day trip from Breck.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="tip-card fade-in">
            <div class="tip-card-icon">&#128142;</div>
            <h3 class="tip-card-title">Vail</h3>
            <p class="tip-card-text">Premium, world-famous, and worth the splurge if your budget allows. Vail has over 5,300 acres -- the largest ski resort in Colorado -- with the legendary Back Bowls offering wide-open powder skiing that's hard to find anywhere else. Vail Village is upscale and beautiful with great dining (but pricey). On the Epic Pass. The catch: lodging in Vail proper is expensive, but you can stay in nearby Frisco or Silverthorne and drive 30 minutes to save significantly.</p>

          <div class="tip-card fade-in">
            <div class="tip-card-icon">&#128293;</div>
            <h3 class="tip-card-title">Arapahoe Basin (A-Basin)</h3>
            <p class="tip-card-text">The hardcore, no-frills mountain that locals love. A-Basin has the highest skiable terrain in North America (13,050 feet) and one of the longest seasons -- often staying open into June. There's no fancy village, just a small base lodge and the legendary 6th Alley bar where you tailgate in the parking lot after skiing. On the Ikon Pass. Best for: groups with experienced skiers who want challenging terrain and don't care about amenities. The East Wall is genuinely terrifying (in the best way).</p>
          </div>
          <div class="tip-card fade-in">
            <div class="tip-card-icon">&#127942;</div>
            <h3 class="tip-card-title">Copper Mountain</h3>
            <p class="tip-card-text">The best value resort in Summit County. Copper is naturally divided by ability level -- beginners on the west side, intermediate in the center, and experts on the east side -- so you'll never accidentally end up on a run that's above your level. Great terrain parks, a fun base village, and consistently cheaper lift tickets than Breck or Vail. On the Ikon Pass. The vibe is more laid-back and less touristy. Excellent choice for budget-conscious groups who still want quality terrain.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="tip-card fade-in">
            <div class="tip-card-icon">&#127956;&#65039;</div>
            <h3 class="tip-card-title">Winter Park</h3>
            <p class="tip-card-text">The closest major resort to Denver (about 75 minutes via I-70 and Berthoud Pass, or take the Winter Park Express train). Winter Park has over 3,000 acres of terrain including the famous Mary Jane side with some of the best mogul runs in Colorado. It's a locals' favorite with a more authentic mountain-town feel and less of the tourist markup. On the Ikon Pass. The Amtrak ski train from Denver Union Station is a unique and fun way to get there -- no driving required, and the scenery is stunning.</p>

          <p class="section-subtitle">Not every resort is created equal, and picking the right mountain for your ability level can make or break your trip. Here's a no-BS breakdown of which Colorado resort matches which skier, with specific runs to hit and insider tips that locals actually use.</p>

            <div class="dest-card-body">
              <h3 class="dest-card-title">&#128994; Keystone for Beginners</h3>
              <p class="dest-card-subtitle">Skill Level: First-Timer to Beginner &bull; Day Pass: $130-$180</p>
              <p class="dest-card-desc"><strong>Why Keystone:</strong> Keystone's Dercum Mountain is a beginner's paradise. The Discovery lift area is literally free for first-timers -- no lift ticket required for the learning zone. The green runs off the Montezuma Express and River Run Gondola are wide, gentle, beautifully groomed, and long enough to actually practice turning without running out of mountain. The ski school here is excellent, with half-day group lessons starting at $120.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-desc"><strong>Standout Runs:</strong> Schoolmarm (the classic beginner run -- 3.5 miles of gentle, winding green), Silver Spoon (easy cruiser with great views), and Ina's Way (a quiet green that most tourists miss). Once you're comfortable, try Last Chance -- a mellow blue that feels like a wide green.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-desc"><strong>Insider Tip:</strong> The Discovery lift area is free, but it gets crowded on weekends. If you're taking a lesson, book the first session of the day (9:00 AM) -- you'll get fresh groomed snow and smaller class sizes. After your lesson, head to the River Run Gondola and ride Schoolmarm top to bottom for practice. It's the longest green run at Keystone and perfect for building confidence.</p>

              <h3 class="dest-card-title">&#128309; Breckenridge for Intermediates</h3>
              <p class="dest-card-subtitle">Skill Level: Intermediate &bull; Day Pass: $150-$210</p>
              <p class="dest-card-desc"><strong>Why Breckenridge:</strong> Breck's five peaks offer the perfect progression for intermediate skiers who are comfortable on blue runs and ready to push into more challenging terrain. Peak 9 is the sweet spot -- a mix of well-groomed blues, playful terrain features, and the occasional black diamond to test your limits. The variety keeps things interesting across multiple days, and the town at the base means you can ski back to Main Street for lunch.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-desc"><strong>Standout Runs:</strong> American (Peak 9, a classic intermediate cruiser with perfect pitch), Crescendo (Peak 9, rolling blue with a fun rhythm), Duke's Run (Peak 9, wide and fast), and Bonanza (Peak 9, the run that makes intermediates feel like experts). When you're feeling bold, try Crystal (Peak 7, a blue-black with gorgeous tree skiing).</p>
              <p class="dest-card-desc"><strong>Insider Tip:</strong> Peak 9 gets crowded by 10 AM on weekends. Start there early, then migrate to Peak 7 or Peak 8 after 11 AM when the crowds shift. The Freeway Terrain Park on Peak 9 has small jumps and features perfect for intermediates who want to try park riding for the first time. Don't sleep on the Falcon SuperChair -- it accesses some of the best intermediate terrain with the shortest lift lines.</p>

              <h3 class="dest-card-title">&#128142; Vail for Advanced Skiers</h3>
              <p class="dest-card-subtitle">Skill Level: Advanced &bull; Day Pass: $200-$270</p>
              <p class="dest-card-desc"><strong>Why Vail:</strong> Vail is the big leagues. With 5,317 acres of skiable terrain, it's the largest ski resort in Colorado and one of the biggest in North America. The front side has impeccable grooming and cruiser runs, but the real draw is the Back Bowls -- seven massive open bowls of ungroomed, above-treeline skiing that stretches for miles. On a powder day, the Back Bowls are a religious experience. The terrain is wide open, the snow is deep, and you'll feel like you have the mountain to yourself.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-desc"><strong>Standout Runs:</strong> Sun Down Bowl (the most accessible Back Bowl, perfect for your first bowl experience), China Bowl (bigger, steeper, more exposed), Blue Sky Basin (remote, requires a traverse, absolutely worth it), and Riva Ridge on the front side (a classic black with steep pitches and gorgeous views of the Gore Range).</p>
              <p class="dest-card-desc"><strong>Insider Tip:</strong> Vail's day pass is the most expensive in Summit County ($200+), so make it count. Go on a powder day if possible -- check OpenSnow.com for forecasts. The Back Bowls face south and get sun all afternoon, so the snow softens and gets slushy by 2 PM. Hit the bowls first thing in the morning for the best conditions. If you're staying in Frisco or Silverthorne, the drive to Vail is 30-40 minutes on I-70 -- totally doable as a day trip from your Summit County cabin.</p>

              <h3 class="dest-card-title">&#128163; A-Basin for Expert Skiers</h3>
              <p class="dest-card-subtitle">Skill Level: Expert &bull; Day Pass: $95-$140</p>
              <p class="dest-card-desc"><strong>Why A-Basin:</strong> Arapahoe Basin is where serious skiers go when they want to be humbled. The summit sits at 13,050 feet -- the highest lift-served terrain in North America. The air is thin, the terrain is steep, and the vibe is hardcore. No fancy village, no overpriced restaurants, just raw mountain and the legendary 6th Alley bar where you tailgate in the parking lot. A-Basin has the cheapest day pass of any major Summit County resort at $95-$140, making it the budget pick for experienced skiers.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-desc"><strong>Standout Runs:</strong> Montezuma Bowl (massive above-treeline bowl, hike-to access, 40+ degree pitch in places), Pallavicini (the most challenging inbounds run in Summit County, steep chutes and cliff bands), East Wall (expert-only, hike-to terrain that's genuinely gnarly), and Lenawee Face (steep groomers that are the perfect warm-up). For a more approachable expert experience, the North Fork zone has excellent tree skiing.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-desc"><strong>Insider Tip:</strong> A-Basin is on the Ikon Pass, not Epic. If your group has Epic Passes for Breck/Keystone, you'll need a separate day ticket for A-Basin. It's worth it. Go on a weekday -- you'll practically have the mountain to yourself. The parking lot tailgate scene after skiing is legendary: people set up grills, coolers, and camp chairs. It's the most authentic ski culture experience in Colorado. Also: A-Basin stays open until June most years, making it the go-to for spring skiing.</p>

              <h3 class="dest-card-title">&#127942; Copper Mountain for All Levels</h3>
              <p class="dest-card-subtitle">Skill Level: All Levels &bull; Day Pass: $120-$170</p>
              <p class="dest-card-desc"><strong>Why Copper:</strong> Copper Mountain's terrain is naturally divided by ability level in a way that no other resort matches. The west side of the mountain (Union Creek) is gentle, wide, and perfect for beginners. The center (Union Peak, Super Bee) has excellent intermediate cruisers. The east side (Copper Bowl, Resolution Bowl, Spaulding Bowl) has steep, challenging expert terrain. You literally can't accidentally end up on a run that's too hard for you. This makes it the best resort for groups with mixed ability levels.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-desc"><strong>Standout Runs:</strong> Roundabout (west side, perfect green for beginners), Copperopolis (center, wide intermediate cruiser), Enchanted Forest (center, fun tree skiing for advancing intermediates), and Resolution Bowl (east side, open above-treeline bowl for experts). The Woodward terrain park is one of the best in Colorado for park riding.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-desc"><strong>Insider Tip:</strong> Copper is on the Ikon Pass and tends to be 20-30% cheaper than Breckenridge for day tickets. The Center Village has a small but solid base area with restaurants and shops. If your group has mixed abilities, start the day together at the Super Bee lift in the center, then split up -- beginners go west, experts go east, everyone meets back at the village for lunch. The free Summit Stage bus connects Copper to Frisco, so you don't need a car if you're staying there.</p>

              <p class="dest-card-subtitle">Skill Level: All Levels &bull; Day Pass: $100-$150</p>
              <p class="dest-card-desc"><strong>Why Winter Park:</strong> Winter Park is the closest major resort to Denver (about 75 minutes) and consistently offers the best value for quality terrain. With over 3,000 acres across Winter Park and the Mary Jane side, there's terrain for everyone. Mary Jane is famous for having some of the best mogul runs in North America -- if you love bumps, this is your mountain. The front side of Winter Park has excellent groomed runs for beginners and intermediates.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-desc"><strong>Standout Runs:</strong> Cranmer (Winter Park side, a long green that winds through beautiful forests), Jabberwocky (Winter Park side, popular intermediate cruiser), Mary Jane Trail (Mary Jane side, the classic mogul run that will destroy your quads in the best way), and Parsenn Bowl (above-treeline bowl for advanced skiers with a short hike). The Trestle terrain park is excellent for all levels.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-desc"><strong>Insider Tip:</strong> Take the Amtrak Winter Park Express ski train from Denver Union Station -- it's $29 each way, runs on weekends and some holidays, and drops you at the base of the mountain. No driving, no parking, no I-70 traffic. The scenery through Moffat Tunnel is gorgeous. Winter Park is on the Ikon Pass and midweek day tickets can be as low as $100. If you're on a tight budget and don't need the Breckenridge town scene, Winter Park gives you 90% of the skiing experience at 60% of the cost.</p>

          <p>If your group has mixed skill levels (which most college groups do), base yourselves near Breckenridge or Copper Mountain. Breck has terrain for every level across five peaks, and Copper's natural ability-level separation means beginners and experts can all enjoy the same resort without stress. On your "switch it up" day, send the advanced skiers to A-Basin or Vail while beginners continue progressing at Keystone.</p>

          <p class="section-subtitle">The skiing is incredible, but the apr&#232;s-ski is what makes a college ski trip legendary. From dive bars with pool tables to hot tub sessions under the stars, here's the definitive guide to everything that happens after you click out of your bindings.</p>

            <h3 class="tip-card-title">Breckenridge Main Street</h3>
            <p class="tip-card-text">Main Street in Breck is the epicenter of college apr&#232;s-ski in Colorado. It's walkable from the base area, lined with over 20 bars and restaurants, and buzzing with energy every evening during ski season. Hit Broken Compass Brewery for the best local craft beer in town -- their Coconut Porter is legendary. Downstairs at Eric's is the classic move: cheap pitchers of beer, solid pizza, and a basement full of arcade games and pool tables. It's been the go-to college ski trip bar for decades and the energy on a Saturday night is unmatched. For something more upscale, grab a seat at Quandary Grill on the patio with a blanket and a cocktail. The Breckenridge Brewery taproom is another staple -- massive portions, craft beer flights, and a lively atmosphere. Happy hour specials run from 3-5 PM at most Main Street spots, with $5 beers and half-price apps.</p>

            <h3 class="tip-card-title">Keystone's Snake River Saloon</h3>
            <p class="tip-card-text">The Snake River Saloon in Keystone is a legendary dive bar that's been serving skiers since 1976. It's not fancy, and that's the entire point. Cheap drinks, pool tables, darts, a jukebox that actually plays good music, and a mix of locals and tourists that creates the perfect casual vibe. The burgers are surprisingly good, the beer is cold, and nobody cares if you're still in your ski boots. This is the kind of bar where you walk in knowing nobody and leave with five new friends. If you're skiing Keystone for a day, don't drive back to Breck for apr&#232;s -- the Snake River Saloon is the move. Ask the bartender about the "Snake Bite" -- it's not on the menu but they'll know what you mean. Tuesday nights are locals' nights with drink specials, and the parking lot scene after closing is half the fun.</p>

            <h3 class="tip-card-title">Hot Tub Sessions</h3>
            <p class="tip-card-text">This is it. This is the moment that defines the college ski trip. Every cabin in Summit County has a hot tub, and after a full day of skiing, sinking into 104-degree water at 9,000 feet elevation while stars appear overhead is genuinely a top-5 life experience. Bring your own drinks (plastic cups only -- no glass near the tub), cue up a playlist on a Bluetooth speaker, and just... exist. The conversations that happen in the hot tub are the ones you'll remember years from now. The cold mountain air on your face, the steam rising around you, the stars that are INSANE at high altitude because there's zero light pollution. Pro tip: do 15-20 minutes in the tub, then jump out and stand in the snow for 30 seconds, then get back in. The contrast is exhilarating. Keep the tub temperature at 100-104&#176;F and avoid it if you've been drinking heavily -- dehydration at altitude plus hot water is a bad combination.</p>

            <h3 class="tip-card-title">Breckenridge Distillery Tour</h3>
            <p class="tip-card-text">The Breckenridge Distillery is the world's highest distillery at 9,600 feet elevation, and the $5 tasting tour is one of the best deals in town. You'll learn how they make their award-winning bourbon, vodka, and gin using Rocky Mountain snowmelt water, then taste 4-5 spirits in a gorgeous tasting room with mountain views. The tour takes about 30 minutes and the tasting room stays open for hanging out afterward. It's walking distance from Main Street and makes a perfect early apr&#232;s activity before dinner. Their bourbon is genuinely world-class -- it's won multiple gold medals at international spirit competitions. Pick up a bottle at the gift shop for the cabin. The distillery also makes a Chili Chile Vodka that's unlike anything you've tasted. The tasting room is warm, inviting, and a nice change of pace from the bar scene.</p>

            <div class="tip-card-icon">&#128717;&#65039;</div>
            <h3 class="tip-card-title">Silverthorne Outlets</h3>
            <p class="tip-card-text">The Outlets at Silverthorne is a massive outdoor shopping center with 50+ stores including North Face, Patagonia, Nike, Columbia, Under Armour, Eddie Bauer, and more -- all at 30-50% off retail. This is the perfect activity for your arrival day (stop on the way to the cabin from Denver), a rest day, or a rainy/snowy day when visibility on the mountain is bad. If you forgot any gear -- ski socks, base layers, gloves, goggles -- you can find them here at discount prices. The North Face outlet regularly has fleece jackets for $40-$60 that retail for $120+. The Nike outlet has deals on athletic wear. There's also a food court and several restaurants in the area. It's located right off I-70 in Silverthorne, about 10 minutes from Breckenridge. Budget 2-3 hours for a proper shopping session. Bring cash if you want to hit the smaller boutique stores that sometimes offer cash discounts.</p>

            <h3 class="tip-card-title">Keystone Night Skiing</h3>
            <p class="tip-card-text">Keystone is one of the only resorts in Colorado that offers night skiing, and it's a totally different experience from daytime riding. On select nights (typically Fridays and Saturdays from mid-December through March), the mountain stays open until 8:00 PM with lit runs on Dercum Mountain. The $50 twilight ticket (valid from 12:30 PM through close) is one of the best deals in Summit County -- you get a full afternoon plus night skiing for less than a regular day pass. Skiing under the lights with fewer crowds, crisp mountain air, and the glow of the village below is magical. The grooming is fresh, the lines are short, and there's something surreal about making turns under the stars. Perfect for your Day 4 "switch it up" day. Finish with dinner and drinks in River Run Village at the base. Tip: night skiing is colder, so layer up heavier than you would during the day. Bring hand warmers and a balaclava.</p>

          <p class="section-subtitle">At least half of every college ski trip group has never been on a mountain before. That's completely normal and part of what makes it fun. Here's everything you need to know so you're not that person in jeans and cotton socks wondering why they can't feel their toes.</p>

            <h3 class="tip-card-title">What to Wear: The Layer System</h3>
            <p class="tip-card-text">Three layers is the magic formula. Base layer: moisture-wicking thermal top and bottom (NOT cotton -- it traps sweat and you'll freeze). Mid layer: a fleece or light down jacket for insulation. Outer layer: waterproof ski jacket and ski pants. Your ski socks should be wool or synthetic, thin, and go up to your knee. One pair is enough -- doubling up causes blisters. Wear a neck gaiter, bring good gloves, and don't forget goggles. You'll be warmer than you think once you start moving.</p>

            <h3 class="tip-card-title">Take a Lesson (Seriously)</h3>
            <p class="tip-card-text">This is the #1 tip for first-timers: take a lesson. Do not let your "experienced" friend teach you. They mean well, but professional ski instructors are trained to teach proper technique from the start, which prevents injuries and bad habits. A half-day group lesson costs $100-$150 and usually includes a beginner lift ticket and rental. You'll learn how to stop (pizza/snowplow), turn, ride the chairlift, and navigate green runs. By afternoon, you'll be skiing on your own and feeling confident.</p>

            <h3 class="tip-card-title">Green Runs vs. Blue Runs</h3>
            <p class="tip-card-text">Trail difficulty is marked by symbols: green circle (easiest), blue square (intermediate), black diamond (advanced), double black (expert only). As a first-timer, stick to green runs on Day 1. They're wide, gentle slopes where you can practice turning and stopping without stress. By Day 2 or 3, confident beginners can try easy blue runs -- they're slightly steeper with more variation. Stay off black diamonds until you're truly comfortable on blues. There's no shame in greens -- everyone starts there, and the views are just as incredible.</p>

            <h3 class="tip-card-title">Altitude Sickness Prevention</h3>
            <p class="tip-card-text">Colorado ski resorts sit at 9,000-13,000 feet above sea level. If you're coming from sea level, your body needs time to adjust. Common symptoms: headache, nausea, fatigue, shortness of breath, and trouble sleeping. Prevention: drink at minimum 3-4 liters of water per day (more than you think), avoid alcohol on your first night, eat carb-heavy meals, take ibuprofen at the first sign of a headache, and don't overexert yourself on Day 1. Some people swear by Liquid IV or electrolyte tablets. If symptoms get severe, the only real cure is descending to a lower altitude.</p>

            <h3 class="tip-card-title">What to Rent vs. What to Buy</h3>
            <p class="tip-card-text">Rent: skis, snowboard, boots, and poles. Unless you plan to ski more than 5 times per year, renting is smarter and cheaper. Book online in advance for 15-20% off walk-in prices. Rent from a shop in town (like Christy Sports in Breck), not at the resort base -- you'll save $10-$20/day. Buy (or bring): goggles, ski socks, base layers, gloves, and a helmet. These are items you'll use again, and the fit matters for comfort and safety. Helmets are critical -- you can rent one, but many students buy a budget helmet for $40-$60 at REI before the trip.</p>

            <div class="tip-card-icon">&#9832;</div>
            <h3 class="tip-card-title">Hot Tub Etiquette (Yes, Really)</h3>
            <p class="tip-card-text">The hot tub is the social hub of every cabin ski trip, so here are the unwritten rules: limit soak time to 15-20 minutes at a time (overheating is real, especially at altitude), bring a towel and wear it to and from the tub (the walk back inside in the cold is shockingly bracing), don't bring glass bottles near the tub (use plastic cups), keep the cover on when not in use (heating costs are real and your Airbnb host will charge you), shower before getting in if you've been skiing all day, and keep the volume reasonable after 10:00 PM if you're in a neighborhood. The hot tub is sacred -- respect it.</p>

            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>Snowboarding is generally slightly cheaper for beginners because rental packages tend to cost $5-$10 less per day, and snowboard lessons are sometimes shorter since many students pick up the basics faster. However, the difference is minimal. A full ski rental package (skis, boots, poles) runs about $35-$55/day, while a snowboard package (board, boots) is $30-$50/day. The real cost difference comes from your multi-day pass and lodging, not the equipment choice. Choose whichever sport interests you more -- the savings either way are negligible. If you've never tried either, skiing is generally considered easier to learn initially but harder to master, while snowboarding has a steeper learning curve but faster progression once you get the basics.</p>

              <p>Keystone and Breckenridge are the best Colorado resorts for beginners. Keystone has an excellent ski school and dedicated beginner terrain at Dercum Mountain with wide, gentle runs that build confidence quickly. Breckenridge offers fantastic beginner terrain at Peak 9 and the Peak 8 base area with plenty of green runs and magic carpet lifts. Copper Mountain is another great option with naturally separated terrain -- beginners on the west side, experts on the east -- so you won't accidentally end up on a difficult run. All three resorts offer first-timer lesson packages ($150-$200) that include a beginner lift ticket, rental equipment, and a group lesson. Take the lesson -- it's worth every penny.</p>

            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>The two main season pass products in Colorado are the Epic Pass and the Ikon Pass. The Epic Pass covers Vail, Breckenridge, Keystone, and Beaver Creek. The Ikon Pass covers Copper Mountain, Winter Park, Arapahoe Basin, and Eldora. For a college ski trip, you probably don't need the full season pass. Instead, buy the Epic Day Pass, which lets you purchase 1-7 days at a significant discount (often 30-50% off window rates). Buy it online at least 7 days before your trip for the best pricing. Other tips: check Liftopia for last-minute deals, look for college student discounts on each resort's website (some offer 20-30% off), and consider skiing 3-4 days instead of 5 to save $100-$200. Never buy lift tickets at the window -- it's always the most expensive option.</p>

            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>Absolutely, and this is a common concern for groups with mixed interest levels. Colorado ski towns offer tons of activities for non-skiers: snow tubing at Keystone or Frisco Adventure Park ($25-$35/hour), snowshoeing on free trails throughout the national forest, visiting the Breckenridge Distillery for tours and tastings, shopping and exploring downtown Breckenridge, ice skating at the Maggie Pond rink in Breckenridge, spa days at local wellness centers, snowmobiling tours ($100-$200), and dog sledding ($150-$250). Many non-skiers simply enjoy the cabin life -- cooking, reading by the fireplace, soaking in the hot tub -- and join the group for apres-ski every afternoon. The cabin hangouts and evening activities are often the highlight of the trip regardless of what you did during the day.</p>

              <span>Should I be worried about altitude sickness?</span>

            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>Altitude sickness is a real concern, not a myth. Breckenridge sits at 9,600 feet elevation, and ski runs go up to 12,998 feet. If you live at sea level, you may experience headaches, nausea, fatigue, shortness of breath, and difficulty sleeping. Prevention tips: drink at least 3-4 liters of water per day starting the day before you arrive, avoid alcohol for the first 24 hours at altitude, eat carb-heavy meals, take it easy on Day 1, and consider taking ibuprofen (Advil) preemptively. Some travelers take Diamox (acetazolamide) -- talk to your doctor before the trip if you're concerned. If symptoms become severe (confusion, persistent vomiting, difficulty breathing), descend to a lower elevation immediately and seek medical attention. Most people adjust within 24-48 hours.</p>

            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>The top cabin rental platforms for Colorado ski trips are: Vrbo (best for large group properties, excellent filters for amenities like hot tubs and ski-in/ski-out), Airbnb (biggest selection, read reviews carefully for accuracy), Vacasa (professionally managed properties with consistent quality and support), and direct resort booking through Breckenridge Grand Vacations or Keystone Resort lodging (sometimes includes lift ticket bundles). Tips for finding the best cabin: book 2-3 months in advance for the best selection and prices, filter for properties that sleep 8-12 people, prioritize cabins with a full kitchen and hot tub, check if parking is included (some Breck properties charge extra), and read the most recent reviews for accuracy. Budget $250-$600/night for a 4-bedroom cabin, which splits to $25-$75/person per night with a group of 8.</p>

            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>Yes, Colorado has a Traction Law (Code 15) that requires adequate tires on I-70 and mountain highways from September through May. You need either snow tires, tires with the M+S (mud and snow) designation, or chains/AutoSocks. All-wheel drive (AWD) vehicles with adequate tread depth are usually compliant. If you're renting a car from Denver International Airport, request an AWD or 4WD vehicle with all-season tires at minimum -- most major rental companies (Enterprise, Hertz, Budget) offer SUVs appropriate for mountain driving. Alternatively, skip driving entirely and take the Bustang bus from Denver Union Station to Breckenridge for about $25 one way, or book a Colorado Mountain Express shuttle ($50-$65 one way). This avoids I-70 traffic, the stress of mountain driving in snow, and the cost of a rental car.</p>

              <p>Essential packing list: Base layers (moisture-wicking thermal top and bottom -- Uniqlo Heattech is great and affordable), mid-layer (fleece or lightweight down jacket), waterproof ski jacket and pants (borrow from a friend if you don't own them), ski socks (wool or synthetic, go up to the knee, bring 2-3 pairs), gloves or mittens (waterproof), neck gaiter or balaclava, goggles (don't ski without them -- wind and sun at altitude is brutal), helmet (rent or buy -- $40-$60 at REI), sunscreen SPF 50+ (you will burn at 10,000+ feet even on cloudy days), lip balm with SPF, hand warmers (HotHands are $1/pair), apres-ski clothes for town (jeans, sweater, boots), swimsuit for the hot tub, reusable water bottle, and any medications. Do NOT pack: cotton socks (instant blisters and frozen feet), jeans to ski in (wet, cold, miserable), a heavy winter parka as your ski jacket (you'll overheat -- ski jackets are designed to breathe), or more than you can carry (you're in a cabin, not a resort).</p>
