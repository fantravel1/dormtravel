Food ranges from $1 tacos on Fremont Street to $25 all-you-can-eat buffets at Bacchanal Buffet. Many shows have student rush tickets for $30-$50, and the Bellagio fountains, Fremont Street light show, and people-watching are completely free.

Most major nightclubs on the Strip (like Hakkasan at MGM Grand, Omnia at Caesars, and XS at Encore) require you to be 21+ with a valid ID. Some clubs offer free entry for women on guest lists, while guys typically pay $20-$50 cover. Sign up for guest lists online 1-2 days before to skip lines and get reduced or free entry.

The LA-to-Vegas route is the most iconic and is the one featured in movies like The Hangover and Swingers.

A reasonable gambling budget for a college student is $50-$100 for the entire trip. Stick to low-stakes games like $5-$10 blackjack tables (available at places like Casino Royale on the Strip), penny slots, or low-buy-in poker tournaments ($40-$65 at places like Aria or The Orleans). Never gamble money you can't afford to lose, and walk away when you hit your limit."

Major pool parties like Encore Beach Club and Wet Republic at MGM Grand open for the season in March. Avoid July and August if you can't handle extreme heat (110°F+). Spring break (mid-March) and Memorial Day weekend are the biggest party weekends. Tickets range from $20-$75 for general admission, with prices higher on weekends and holidays."

            <h3 class="tip-card-title">Surprisingly Affordable</h3>
            <p class="tip-card-text">Split a hotel room 4 ways and you're paying $15-$25 per person per night -- even on the Strip. Off-strip hotels like The Orleans or Palace Station can be under $40/night total. Add in $5 meals at Tacos El Gordo and free attractions like the Bellagio fountains, and Vegas is legitimately one of the cheapest trips you can take.</p>

            <p class="tip-card-text">Cirque du Soleil, headliner residencies, comedy shows, magic acts -- Vegas has more entertainment per square mile than anywhere on Earth. Student rush tickets can get you into major shows for $30-$50. Plus, free shows like the Bellagio fountains and the Fremont Street Experience run all night long.</p>

            <p class="tip-card-text">From the legendary Bacchanal Buffet at Caesars to hidden gems like Secret Pizza inside the Cosmopolitan, Vegas has food for every budget. Hit In-N-Out on the Strip for a $5 meal, explore Chinatown for incredible ramen and dim sum under $15, or splurge on a Gordon Ramsay burger. Your taste buds will thank you.</p>

            <p class="tip-card-text">Vegas invented the daytime pool party, and it's a college student's dream. Encore Beach Club, Wet Republic at MGM Grand, and Marquee Dayclub turn resort pools into open-air nightclubs with world-class DJs. General admission starts around $20-$40, and the vibes are absolutely unmatched from noon to sunset.</p>

            <p class="tip-card-text">The LA-to-Vegas drive through the Mojave Desert is a movie scene come to life. Four hours of open road, desert landscapes, and the moment you first see the Vegas skyline rising from the sand. Stop at Seven Magic Mountains for photos, grab In-N-Out in Barstow, and crank the playlist. The road trip IS the experience.</p>

            <p class="tip-card-text">There's a reason "what happens in Vegas" became the most quoted travel phrase in history. Whether it's winning $200 at blackjack, seeing a surprise celebrity DJ set, accidentally ending up at a 4am buffet, or watching the sunrise from the top of a parking garage -- Vegas creates stories you'll tell at every reunion for the rest of your life.</p>

              <p class="dest-card-text">The classic I-15 drive through the Mojave Desert -- the route that launched a thousand college road trips. This is the one from Swingers, The Hangover, and every movie that made Vegas a rite of passage. Leave by 2pm on Friday and you'll arrive in time for dinner on the Strip. Stop at the Barstow Outlets for cheap gear and the Mad Greek in Baker for a gyro and a photo with the world's tallest thermometer. Gas split 4 ways runs about $8-10 per person. Traffic hack: avoid leaving LA between 3-7pm on Fridays or you'll add 2 hours sitting on I-15 near Victorville.</p>

              <p class="dest-card-text">Desert scenery that looks like a Western movie set the entire drive. Take US-93 northwest and make the mandatory stop at Hoover Dam -- the $10 tour is absolutely worth it and one of the most impressive engineering feats you'll ever see in person. Hit Kingman, Arizona for Route 66 vibes, vintage diners, and a quick stretch. The last hour into Vegas as the sun sets is genuinely cinematic. Gas split 4 ways is about $10 per person. Pro tip: fill up in Kingman because gas prices spike as you approach the Nevada border.</p>

              <p class="dest-card-text">Take I-15 north through the desert and you'll pass through some of the most surreal landscape in California. The must-stop is Zzyzx Road -- yes, it's a real place, and it has the coolest road sign ever. Everyone gets out for photos. It's the last alphabetically named road in America and it leads to an old mineral springs resort in the middle of nowhere. Stop in Primm at the state line for cheap gas and the outlet mall. Gas split 4 ways runs about $10 per person. The drive is easy, flat, and fast once you clear the mountains east of San Diego.</p>

              <p class="dest-card-text">The long haul. This is a serious commitment -- 9 hours of driving through California's Central Valley and across the desert. If you're determined to drive, split it: stop overnight in Bakersfield (cheap motels around $50) or take the Death Valley detour for an unforgettable side quest through the lowest point in North America. Honestly though? It's better to fly. Spirit and Southwest run flights from SFO/OAK to Vegas for $60-80 each way, and you'll save an entire day of driving. Gas split 4 ways is about $18 per person, so flying is barely more expensive and way less exhausting.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-text"><strong>&#127925; Playlist vibe:</strong> Long-drive marathon mix. Podcasts for the Central Valley, EDM to stay awake through the desert, then full hype mode for the final hour.</p>

          <p class="pro-tip-text">No matter which route you take, download your music and podcasts before you leave. Cell service is spotty through the desert stretches, especially between Barstow and Primm on I-15. Also, bring a car charger with at least 2 USB ports -- everyone will need their phone charged for navigation and the group chat. And pack a small cooler with water and snacks. Gas station prices in the middle of the desert are highway robbery (literally).</p>

          <p class="section-subtitle">Where you stay matters. Here's the honest breakdown of the best Vegas hotels for college students -- sorted by budget, location, and vibe. No travel blog fluff, just real talk.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="dest-grid">
          <div class="dest-card fade-in">
            <div class="dest-card-content">
              <span class="dest-card-badge">&#11088; Best Overall</span>
              <h3 class="dest-card-title">The LINQ Hotel + Experience</h3>
              <p class="dest-card-stats">&#128176; $60-$100/night &bull; Center Strip &bull; &#127946; Pool: 8/10</p>
              <p class="dest-card-text">The best value on the entire Strip for college students, period. The LINQ sits dead center of the action -- you can walk to everything from the Bellagio to the Venetian in minutes. The High Roller observation wheel is literally in the backyard. The crowd skews young (20s and 30s), the rooms are modern and clean, and the pool area is solid without being a full-blown dayclub. The LINQ Promenade downstairs has Brooklyn Bowl for live music, In-N-Out, and plenty of bars.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-text"><strong>&#128161; Student tip:</strong> Watch out for the resort fee ($40/night) that gets added at checkout. It's not included in the booking price. Split a room 4 ways and you're paying $25-35 per person per night including the fee. Book directly through their site on weekdays for the best rates.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="dest-card fade-in">

              <span class="dest-card-badge">&#128176; Budget King</span>
              <h3 class="dest-card-title">Excalibur Hotel &amp; Casino</h3>
              <p class="dest-card-stats">&#128176; $40-$70/night &bull; South Strip &bull; &#127946; Pool: 7/10</p>
              <p class="dest-card-text">Cheapest on-Strip hotel that's actually decent. Yes, it's medieval themed. Yes, it looks like a castle from outside. Yes, that's kind of ridiculous. But lean into it -- it's fun in an ironic way, and your wallet will thank you. The rooms are basic but clean, the pool is surprisingly good with a decent deck area, and you're connected to Luxor and Mandalay Bay via indoor walkways. South Strip location means you're close to the airport and the Welcome to Las Vegas sign.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-text"><strong>&#128161; Student tip:</strong> The food court inside has $8-10 meals. The Tournament of Kings dinner show is $65 but includes a full meal -- surprisingly entertaining after a few drinks. Resort fee is around $35/night. Split a room 4 ways and it's $20-25 per person.</p>
            </div>

              <h3 class="dest-card-title">Flamingo Las Vegas</h3>
              <p class="dest-card-stats">&#128176; $50-$90/night &bull; Center Strip &bull; &#127946; Pool: 9/10</p>
              <p class="dest-card-text">The Flamingo is old-school Vegas charm meets modern pool party energy. The GO Pool hosts regular pool parties with DJs and a younger crowd. The center Strip location is unbeatable -- you're steps from the LINQ Promenade and Caesars Palace. The wildlife habitat with real flamingos is free and genuinely cool. Rooms have been renovated and are better than the price suggests. The pink neon exterior is one of the most photographed spots on the Strip.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-text"><strong>&#128161; Student tip:</strong> The GO Pool parties are cheaper than Encore Beach Club or Wet Republic ($20-30 entry) and still have great vibes. Resort fee is $42/night which stings, so factor that in. The Margaritaville restaurant downstairs has a balcony overlooking the Strip -- great for people watching.</p>

              <p class="dest-card-stats">&#128176; $35-$60/night &bull; North Strip &bull; &#127946; Pool: 6/10</p>
              <p class="dest-card-text">Literally the cheapest hotel on the Las Vegas Strip. It's campy, it's dated, and it has an indoor amusement park called the Adventuredome. Is it glamorous? No. Is it budget gold for college students who plan to spend zero time in the room? Absolutely. The north Strip location means you're a 15-minute walk (or $8 Uber) from the center action, but you'll save $30-50/night compared to mid-Strip hotels. The Adventuredome is actually fun after a few drinks -- roller coasters and carnival games inside a casino.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-text"><strong>&#128161; Student tip:</strong> Resort fee is only $32/night -- lowest on the Strip. Rooms are basic but functional. The Slots-A-Fun bar next door has $3 beers and $1 hot dogs. Split 4 ways, you're paying $17-23 per person per night. That's hostel pricing for a Strip hotel.</p>

              <h3 class="dest-card-title">The Orleans (Off-Strip)</h3>
              <p class="dest-card-stats">&#128176; $40-$65/night &bull; Off-Strip &bull; &#127946; Pool: 7/10</p>
              <p class="dest-card-text">If you don't mind being off the Strip, The Orleans is a hidden gem that locals love. Free shuttle runs to the Strip every 30 minutes, so you're never stranded. The hotel has its own bowling alley (70-lane, open till 2am), movie theater, and multiple restaurants with prices 30-40% cheaper than Strip equivalents. The vibe is more relaxed and less tourist-heavy. The casino has $5 blackjack tables all day (good luck finding that on the Strip). Great for groups who want a home base that's comfortable without paying Strip premiums.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-text"><strong>&#128161; Student tip:</strong> The resort fee is only $28/night. The on-site restaurants are genuinely good and affordable -- the oyster bar and the burger spot are both under $15. The poker room has $40 daily tournaments that are beginner-friendly. Split 4 ways, you're at $17-24 per person per night.</p>

              <h3 class="dest-card-title">Airbnb Off-Strip</h3>
              <p class="dest-card-stats">&#128176; $25-$40/person/night &bull; Off-Strip &bull; &#127946; Pool: Varies</p>
              <p class="dest-card-text">For larger groups (6-10 people), an Airbnb off the Strip can be the smartest move. You get a full kitchen for pregaming and cooking breakfast (saving $15-20/day on food), a living room for the crew to hang out, often a private pool, and way more space than a cramped hotel room. Most off-Strip Airbnbs are a $8-12 Uber ride from the center of the action. Look for places in the Spring Valley or Summerlin areas -- safe neighborhoods with grocery stores nearby.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-text"><strong>&#128161; Student tip:</strong> Book 2-3 months in advance for the best selection. Make sure the listing allows parties and has good reviews from groups. Downside: no casino access or hotel amenities. Upside: you can be as loud as you want and the kitchen pays for itself. Buy groceries at Smith's or Walmart (both have locations 10 min from the Strip) and save a fortune.</p>

        <div class="pro-tip fade-in">
          <div class="pro-tip-label">&#128161; Resort Fee Warning</div>
          <p class="pro-tip-text">Every hotel on the Las Vegas Strip charges a mandatory "resort fee" of $30-$50 per night on top of the listed room price. This is NOT included in the rate you see on booking sites. A $50/night room becomes $90/night after the resort fee. Always factor this into your budget. Some off-strip hotels have lower fees ($20-$30), and Airbnbs have none. This is the biggest hidden cost that catches college students off guard in Vegas. Check the hotel's website directly for the exact resort fee amount before booking.</p>

          <p class="section-subtitle">Vegas wants you to think everything costs money. It doesn't. Some of the best experiences in the city are completely free or shockingly cheap. Here's your no-budget-required hit list.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="tips-grid">

            <h3 class="tip-card-title">Bellagio Fountains</h3>
            <p class="tip-card-text"><strong>Free.</strong> Every 15 minutes in the afternoon, every 30 minutes at night. This is THE iconic Vegas moment -- 1,200 water jets choreographed to music in front of the Bellagio. It never gets old, even locals stop to watch. Best viewed from the pedestrian bridge between Bellagio and Paris Las Vegas for an elevated angle. The nighttime shows set to Frank Sinatra or Tiesto are genuinely breathtaking. You'll come back to watch it multiple times during your trip. Pro tip: the viewing spot right at the railing in front of the hotel is the most popular, but the bridge gives you the best photos.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="tip-card fade-in">
            <div class="tip-card-icon">&#127905;</div>
            <h3 class="tip-card-title">Fremont Street Experience</h3>
            <p class="tip-card-text"><strong>Free.</strong> Downtown Vegas is where the magic started before the Strip existed, and Fremont Street is the heart of it all. The Viva Vision canopy is a 1,500-foot-long LED screen that runs light shows every hour after dark -- it's insane and completely free. The bars downtown have cheaper drinks than anything on the Strip ($5-8 vs $15-20). Live bands play on outdoor stages every night. The SlotZilla zip line costs $25-$55 and sends you flying over the entire crowd. This is where the real Vegas energy lives -- less polished, more authentic, way more fun on a budget.</p>

          <div class="tip-card fade-in">
            <div class="tip-card-icon">&#127755;</div>
            <h3 class="tip-card-title">Mirage Volcano</h3>
            <p class="tip-card-text"><strong>Free.</strong> A massive artificial volcano that erupts nightly right on the Strip, shooting fire and water into the sky. Is it cheesy? Absolutely. Is it classic Vegas? 100%. The eruption runs at 8pm and 9pm (and 10pm on weekends) and lasts about 5 minutes. It's a spectacle that's been running since 1989 and it's still impressive. Stand right at the railing on Las Vegas Boulevard for the full heat-in-your-face experience. Combine it with a walk to see the Bellagio fountains -- they're just a few minutes apart on foot.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="tip-card fade-in">
            <div class="tip-card-icon">&#127926;</div>
            <h3 class="tip-card-title">LINQ Promenade</h3>
            <p class="tip-card-text"><strong>Free to walk.</strong> The outdoor shopping, dining, and entertainment district right behind the LINQ Hotel. It's people-watching paradise -- street performers, neon lights, and the full Vegas atmosphere without stepping into a casino. Brooklyn Bowl is here for live music ($10-30 for shows), plus a bunch of bars with happy hour deals. The promenade connects directly to the High Roller observation wheel. Great for a casual evening when you want the vibe without the expense. The O'Sheas bar inside the LINQ has beer pong and $5 drinks -- basically a college bar on the Strip.</p>

          <div class="tip-card fade-in">
            <div class="tip-card-icon">&#127752;</div>
            <h3 class="tip-card-title">Seven Magic Mountains</h3>
            <p class="tip-card-text"><strong>Free.</strong> About 30 minutes south of the Strip (on the way if you're driving from LA), this is a massive art installation of giant neon-painted boulders stacked 30+ feet high in the middle of the desert. It's THE Instagram spot for anyone visiting Vegas. Created by Swiss artist Ugo Rondinone, the fluorescent colors against the brown desert backdrop are surreal. Go at sunrise or sunset for the best photos. There's a small parking lot that fills up on weekends, so go early. Combine this with a stop at the Welcome to Las Vegas sign on your way back to the Strip.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="tip-card fade-in">
            <div class="tip-card-icon">&#128248;</div>
            <h3 class="tip-card-title">Welcome to Las Vegas Sign</h3>
            <p class="tip-card-text"><strong>Free.</strong> The "Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas Nevada" sign at the south end of the Strip. Everyone does it, and you should too. The line moves faster than you'd think -- usually 5-10 minutes during the day, longer at night when the sign is lit up. There's a small parking lot right behind it, or you can walk from Mandalay Bay in about 10 minutes. Best time is early morning for no line and good lighting, or at night for the classic neon glow. A volunteer photographer is usually there to take your group photo. Don't skip this -- it's a Vegas essential.</p>

            <div class="tip-card-icon">&#127905;</div>
            <h3 class="tip-card-title">High Roller at Night</h3>
            <p class="tip-card-text"><strong>$25 with student ID.</strong> The world's tallest observation wheel (550 feet) takes 30 minutes to complete one rotation and gives you the best panoramic views of the entire Las Vegas Strip and surrounding desert. Go at night -- the city lights are absolutely spectacular from the top. The open bar option ($50) includes unlimited drinks for the full 30-minute ride, which is actually a decent deal considering Strip drink prices. Each pod holds up to 40 people. Book online for cheaper tickets than the walk-up booth. The sunset ride (about an hour before dark) gives you both daylight and nighttime views.</p>

            <div class="tip-card-icon">&#128373;</div>
            <h3 class="tip-card-title">The Mob Museum Downtown</h3>
            <p class="tip-card-text"><strong>$20 general admission.</strong> This is surprisingly one of the most fascinating museums you'll ever visit. Three floors of real organized crime history -- actual FBI surveillance equipment, the wall from the St. Valentine's Day Massacre, and interactive crime scene exhibits. But the best part is the underground speakeasy and distillery in the basement. You enter through an unmarked door (ask the front desk for the password) and it's a fully operational Prohibition-era bar with craft cocktails for $12-15. Very cool date activity or a unique group outing. Allow 2-3 hours. Student discount brings it to $16 with a valid ID.</p>

              <p class="dest-card-stats">&#128176; ~$8 &bull; LINQ Promenade &bull; Best: Late Night</p>
              <p class="dest-card-text">The only In-N-Out Burger location directly ON the Las Vegas Strip, right at the LINQ Promenade. At 3am when you're stumbling back from a club, this place is an absolute lifesaver. Double-Double Animal Style, fries, and a shake for under $12. The line can wrap around the building on weekend nights, but it moves fast. Walking distance from LINQ, Flamingo, Harrah's, and the Venetian. If you're from the East Coast and have never had In-N-Out, this is a non-negotiable experience. Open until 1:30am Sunday-Thursday, 2:30am Friday-Saturday.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-text"><strong>&#128161; Insider tip:</strong> Order "Animal Style" on both your burger and fries. Ask for chopped chilis. Get a Neapolitan shake. You're welcome.</p>

              <p class="dest-card-stats">&#128176; ~$3/taco &bull; Charleston Blvd (off-strip) &bull; Best: Dinner</p>
              <p class="dest-card-text">These are genuinely the best street tacos you'll ever eat. Tacos El Gordo is a Tijuana import that serves authentic Mexican street tacos with handmade tortillas, spit-roasted meats, and toppings that make Taco Bell look like a war crime. The adobada (marinated pork) tacos are the signature move -- $3 each and absolutely loaded. The line is always long and it's always worth it. The main location on Charleston Boulevard is off-strip but only a $6-8 Uber ride. There's also a Strip-adjacent location on the north end, but the off-strip one is better.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-text"><strong>&#128161; Insider tip:</strong> Get 3-4 tacos per person (they're not huge). Try the adobada AND the lengua (beef tongue -- trust us). Cash and card accepted. Bring napkins, it gets messy.</p>

              <p class="dest-card-stats">&#128176; ~$70 &bull; Caesars Palace &bull; Best: Weekend Brunch</p>
              <p class="dest-card-text">Yes, $70 is a lot for college students. But this is the ONE splurge meal that's worth every single penny. Bacchanal Buffet is consistently rated the best buffet in Las Vegas with over 250 dishes spanning 9 different kitchens. Unlimited crab legs, prime rib, sushi, dim sum, custom pasta, wood-fired pizza, and a dessert section that could make a pastry chef cry. You will eat your body weight in food. Go for the weekend brunch which includes bottomless mimosas. Skip breakfast that morning and don't eat dinner after. This IS your food for the entire day.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-text"><strong>&#128161; Insider tip:</strong> Go on a weekday for shorter lines. Start with the seafood (crab legs first -- they run out), then meats, then dessert. Take breaks between plates. The chocolate fountain is real.</p>

              <p class="dest-card-stats">&#128176; $15-$20 &bull; Miracle Mile Shops (Planet Hollywood) &bull; Best: Brunch</p>
              <p class="dest-card-text">Hash House A Go Go is famous for one thing: insanely huge portions. We're talking a single plate of pancakes that could feed a family of four. A chicken waffle the size of your torso. Meatloaf that weighs more than a newborn. The portions are so big that splitting one plate between two people is a legitimate strategy and you'll both be stuffed. The location inside Miracle Mile Shops at Planet Hollywood is convenient to the center Strip. Perfect for a recovery brunch after a big night out. The "Twisted Farm Food" concept means everything is comfort food on steroids.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-text"><strong>&#128161; Insider tip:</strong> Order one entree and split it. Seriously. The Andy's Sage Fried Chicken Benedict is the signature dish. Take a photo next to your plate for scale -- it's content gold. Go before 11am on weekdays to avoid the line.</p>

              <p class="dest-card-stats">&#128176; ~$6/slice &bull; Cosmopolitan 3rd Floor &bull; Best: 2AM</p>
              <p class="dest-card-text">There's no sign. No menu on the wall. No indication it exists unless you know where to look. Secret Pizza is hidden on the 3rd floor of the Cosmopolitan -- take the elevator up, turn right, and follow the hallway lined with vinyl records and album covers. You'll know you're close when you smell fresh pizza and see a line of people who look like they just discovered something amazing. The New York-style slices are huge, perfectly cheesy, and exactly what you need at 2am after a night out. This is hands-down the best late-night food on the entire Strip.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-text"><strong>&#128161; Insider tip:</strong> The pepperoni is the move. Cash or card accepted. The line looks long but moves fast (5-10 min). Go between 1-3am for the full experience of discovering it with other happy, hungry people. Take the hallway photos for Instagram.</p>

              <p class="dest-card-stats">&#128176; ~$8 &bull; Planet Hollywood (Miracle Mile) &bull; Best: Anytime</p>
              <p class="dest-card-text">It sounds basic. It's a sandwich shop in a mall food court. But Earl of Sandwich is genuinely one of the best meals you'll eat in Vegas, and at $8 for a full sandwich, it's an absolute steal. The Holiday Turkey sandwich (turkey, cornbread stuffing, gravy, and cranberry sauce on freshly baked bread) is legendary -- people fly to Vegas specifically to eat it. The Original 1762 (roast beef, cheddar, horseradish) is another classic. Open late (usually until midnight), so it's a great pre-club fuel stop or a quick cheap dinner when you don't want to spend $40 on a mediocre Strip restaurant.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-text"><strong>&#128161; Insider tip:</strong> Get the Holiday Turkey. That's the tip. Also grab one of their warm brownies ($3) -- they're ridiculous. The Miracle Mile food court also has decent Chinese and a burger spot if your crew wants variety.</p>

          <p class="pro-tip-text">Here's how to eat well in Vegas on a student budget: Do one buffet splurge (Bacchanal or Wicked Spoon) early in the trip and make it your one big meal for the day. For other meals, rotate between In-N-Out, Tacos El Gordo, and Earl of Sandwich for $8-12 per meal. Buy water and snacks from CVS or Walgreens ($4 for a case of water vs $5 per bottle at the hotel). Hit the hotel room for snacks between meals. Average daily food spend using this strategy: $25-35 per person, including one nice meal.</p>

          <h2 class="section-title">Pool Party &amp; Day Club <span class="gradient-text">Guide</span></h2>
          <p class="section-subtitle">Vegas invented the dayclub, and pool parties are the single most quintessential Vegas experience for college students. Here's where to go, what to pay, and how to get in cheap.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="dest-grid">
          <div class="dest-card fade-in">
            <div class="dest-card-content">
              <span class="dest-card-badge">&#128081; The A-List</span>
              <h3 class="dest-card-title">Encore Beach Club</h3>
              <p class="dest-card-stats">&#128176; $30-$75 entry &bull; Encore/Wynn &bull; Season: Mar-Oct</p>
              <p class="dest-card-text">The gold standard of Vegas pool parties. Encore Beach Club (EBC) is where the biggest DJs in the world play daytime sets -- think David Guetta, Marshmello, Diplo, and Tiesto. The production quality is nightclub-level with a massive LED screen, pyrotechnics, and sound system that shakes the water. The crowd is young, the energy is electric, and the scene is exactly what you picture when you think "Vegas pool party." Table minimums can run $1,000-$5,000+, so general admission is the move for students. Arrive by noon to get a good spot near the main pool.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-text"><strong>&#128161; Strategy:</strong> Buy tickets online in advance for the lowest price. Friday and Saturday have the biggest DJs but highest prices. Sunday is "industry night" with slightly cheaper entry and a more relaxed vibe. Eat a big breakfast before -- food inside is $18-25 per item. Bring a waterproof phone case.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

              <h3 class="dest-card-title">Wet Republic at MGM Grand</h3>
              <p class="dest-card-stats">&#128176; $30-$50 entry &bull; MGM Grand &bull; Season: Mar-Oct</p>
              <p class="dest-card-text">Wet Republic is the pool party for hip-hop and electronic music lovers. The vibe skews younger and more energetic than some of the other dayclubs, which makes it a natural fit for college crowds. Big-name DJs and hip-hop artists perform regularly. The two saltwater pools are massive, the cabanas are Instagram-worthy, and the views of the south Strip add to the atmosphere. Located at MGM Grand, so you're right in the middle of the action. The sound system is ridiculous and the DJ booth overlooks the entire venue.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-text"><strong>&#128161; Strategy:</strong> Thursday is the most popular college night. Guest lists through promoters can save $10-20 on entry. The general admission area closest to the DJ booth is where the energy is highest. Lockers are $20 to store your stuff -- worth it so you're not worrying about your phone.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="dest-card fade-in">

              <span class="dest-card-badge">&#127774; Intimate Vibes</span>
              <h3 class="dest-card-title">Marquee Dayclub at Cosmopolitan</h3>
              <p class="dest-card-stats">&#128176; $20-$40 entry &bull; Cosmopolitan &bull; Season: Mar-Oct</p>
              <p class="dest-card-text">Marquee Dayclub offers a more intimate pool party experience compared to the mega-venues. It's smaller, which means you're closer to the DJ and the energy feels more personal. The music leans electronic and house, with consistently great lineups. The bungalows and daybeds give it a more upscale feel, but general admission is still very affordable at $20-40. Located at the Cosmopolitan, which is already one of the coolest hotels on the Strip. The rooftop setting gives you incredible views of the city while you party.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-text"><strong>&#128161; Strategy:</strong> Marquee often has lower entry prices than EBC or Wet Republic, making it the best value dayclub on the Strip. Monday and Friday events tend to be more affordable. After the pool party closes at 6pm, the nightclub opens -- combo tickets for both are a great deal.</p>
            </div>

              <h3 class="dest-card-title">Stadium Swim at Circa</h3>
              <p class="dest-card-stats">&#128176; $20-$45 entry &bull; Circa (Downtown) &bull; Year-Round</p>
              <p class="dest-card-text">The newest and most unique pool experience in Vegas. Stadium Swim at Circa Resort (downtown) combines a massive 40-foot LED screen showing live sports with a multi-level pool amphitheater. Think: watching March Madness or NFL Sunday from a pool with a drink in your hand. Six pools across multiple levels, each with a different vibe from chill to party. It's the perfect combo of sports bar and pool party that doesn't exist anywhere else. Because it's downtown, prices are lower than Strip dayclubs, and the crowd is a fun mix of sports fans and pool partiers.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-text"><strong>&#128161; Strategy:</strong> Go on game days -- the energy when a big game is on is incredible. Heated pools mean this venue operates year-round, unlike Strip dayclubs. Combine with a Fremont Street night for a full downtown day-to-night experience. The venue is 21+ only.</p>

          <div class="pro-tip-label">&#128161; Pool Party Pro Tip</div>
          <p class="pro-tip-text">Most pool parties offer free entry for women before noon on weekdays -- this is the biggest money hack in Vegas. Guys can sometimes get on guest lists through promoters on Instagram -- search #VegasGuestList or #VegasPoolParty and DM promoters 2-3 days before your trip. They'll add your name to a list for free or reduced entry. Always bring cash for tips (servers remember you). Apply sunscreen BEFORE you get there and reapply every 2 hours -- the Vegas desert sun at a pool party will absolutely destroy you. Bring a waterproof phone pouch ($10 on Amazon) to protect your phone and still take photos in the water.</p>

            <p class="tip-card-text">Skip the overpriced hotel restaurants and hit these spots: Tacos El Gordo on the Strip ($3-$5 tacos), Secret Pizza at the Cosmopolitan ($6 slices), In-N-Out right on the Strip ($5 combo), and Chinatown's Spring Mountain Road for $10-$15 meals that rival any expensive restaurant. For breakfast, Earl of Sandwich at Planet Hollywood does killer $7 breakfast sandwiches. And never underestimate a good CVS grocery run for water, snacks, and drinks to keep in the hotel room.</p>

            <h3 class="tip-card-title">Pool Party Hacks</h3>
            <p class="tip-card-text">Get on the guest list 1-2 days before through promoter Instagram accounts or sites like NoWaitList. Women often get free entry on weekdays with guest lists; guys pay $20-$30 instead of $50+. Go early (gates open at 11am) to get a good spot. Bring a waterproof phone case. Pre-game before because drinks inside are $15-$20 each. Eat a big meal beforehand -- you'll be in the sun for hours. And sunscreen is non-negotiable -- the Vegas desert sun at a pool party will destroy you.</p>

            <h3 class="tip-card-title">Gambling Tips for Beginners</h3>
            <p class="tip-card-text">Rule number one: set a strict budget and put it in a separate pocket or envelope. When it's gone, it's gone. Start with $5-$10 blackjack tables at Casino Royale (cheapest on the Strip). Learn basic blackjack strategy before you go -- it reduces the house edge to under 1%. Avoid slot machines (highest house edge). Try craps -- it looks intimidating but the "pass line" bet is one of the best odds in the casino. And remember: the house always wins long-term. Treat gambling as entertainment, not income.</p>

            <h3 class="tip-card-title">Best Free Things in Vegas</h3>
            <p class="tip-card-text">Vegas has an incredible amount of free entertainment. The Bellagio fountains (every 15-30 min) never get old. The Fremont Street Experience light show runs hourly after dark. Walk through the Bellagio Conservatory botanical gardens, which change with the seasons. See the flamingos (real ones!) at the Flamingo Wildlife Habitat. Watch the Mirage volcano erupt at night. Check out the Fall of Atlantis show at the Forum Shops. And people-watching on the Strip is honestly some of the best free entertainment on Earth.</p>

            <h3 class="tip-card-title">Staying Hydrated in the Desert</h3>
            <p class="tip-card-text">This is not a joke -- Vegas is in the middle of the Mojave Desert and dehydration sneaks up fast, especially if you're drinking alcohol and spending time at pool parties. Buy a case of water bottles from CVS or Walgreens ($4 for a 24-pack) and keep them in your hotel room. Drink at least one bottle of water for every alcoholic drink. Carry a reusable water bottle everywhere. If you start getting headaches or feeling dizzy, you're already dehydrated. The free water you can get while gambling at tables is a bonus hydration strategy.</p>

            <h3 class="tip-card-title">Splitting Costs with Friends</h3>
            <p class="tip-card-text">Vegas is built for group travel. Use Splitwise or Venmo to track expenses in real time -- nothing kills a friendship faster than arguing about money on the last day. Split the hotel room 4 ways (even 3 beds + 1 pullout works for one trip). Rent one car instead of multiple Ubers. Buy bulk snacks and drinks from a grocery store together. For restaurants, ask for separate checks upfront. Designate one person as the "trip treasurer" who books everything and gets reimbursed. It keeps things organized and drama-free.</p>

          <p class="section-subtitle">You're going to gamble in Vegas. Everyone does. The difference between a fun story and a financial disaster is knowing the basics before you sit down at a table. Here's everything you need to know.</p>

            <h3 class="tip-card-title">Set Your Budget First</h3>
            <p class="tip-card-text">Before you step foot in a casino, decide exactly how much you're willing to lose. Not how much you want to win -- how much you're OK losing. Put that cash in a separate envelope or pocket and leave your debit card in the hotel room safe. When the envelope is empty, you're done gambling for the trip. A reasonable college student gambling budget is $50-$100 for a 3-5 day trip. Never chase losses (trying to win back what you lost by betting more). Never borrow money to gamble. Never use rent money, tuition money, or money you need for food. This is entertainment spending, period.</p>

            <h3 class="tip-card-title">Best Games for Beginners</h3>
            <p class="tip-card-text"><strong>Blackjack ($5-$10 tables):</strong> The best game for beginners. Simple rules -- get closer to 21 than the dealer without going over. Learn basic strategy before you go (there are free apps) and you'll reduce the house edge to under 1%. Look for $5 minimum tables at Casino Royale on the Strip or downtown casinos. <strong>Roulette (outside bets):</strong> Bet red/black or odd/even for nearly 50/50 odds. Easy to understand, no strategy needed. <strong>Craps:</strong> Looks intimidating with all the shouting, but the "pass line" bet has some of the best odds in the casino (1.41% house edge). Stand at the table and watch for 10 minutes before jumping in -- the other players will teach you.</p>

            <h3 class="tip-card-title">Free Drinks While Gambling</h3>
            <p class="tip-card-text">Yes, really -- casinos give you free alcoholic drinks while you're actively gambling. This is one of the best perks of Vegas and a major budget hack. Here's how it works: sit at any table game or slot machine and a cocktail server will come around. Order whatever you want -- beer, cocktails, mixed drinks -- and it's free. Tip your server $1-2 per drink (this is expected and ensures they keep coming back to you). You can technically play penny slots at the minimum bet to qualify for free drinks, though servers will prioritize players at table games. Don't abuse this system -- pace yourself, because dehydration + free alcohol + desert heat = a very bad morning.</p>

            <div class="tip-card-icon">&#127915;</div>
            <h3 class="tip-card-title">Sign Up for Players Cards</h3>
            <p class="tip-card-text">This is free money that most college students don't know about. Every casino has a rewards program (Caesars Rewards, MGM Rewards, Wynn Rewards, etc.) that gives you a free card to track your play. Sign up at the Players Club desk (takes 5 minutes, free, just need an ID). Insert the card into slot machines or give it to the dealer at table games. As you play, you earn points that convert to free buffets, upgraded hotel rooms, show tickets, and other comps. Even on a small budget, you can earn enough for a free meal or two. The sign-up bonuses alone sometimes include free slot play ($5-$20) or a complimentary drink. There's zero downside.</p>

            <h3 class="tip-card-title">Downtown vs. Strip Gambling</h3>
            <p class="tip-card-text">This is the single biggest money-saving gambling tip: play downtown, not on the Strip. Downtown casinos (Fremont Street area) have $5 minimum blackjack tables all day and night. Strip casinos have $15-$25 minimums during peak hours, sometimes $50+ on weekend nights. That means your $100 gambling budget lasts 2-3x longer downtown. Casinos like El Cortez, Golden Nugget, The D, and Four Queens all have $5 tables. The downtown atmosphere is also more fun and casual -- dealers are friendlier, the crowds are less pretentious, and the drinks flow just as freely. If you want the Strip experience, Casino Royale has the lowest table minimums on Las Vegas Boulevard ($5-$10).</p>

            <h3 class="tip-card-title">When to Walk Away</h3>
            <p class="tip-card-text">The hardest part of gambling isn't learning the games -- it's knowing when to stop. Here are the rules: <strong>Up 50%?</strong> Cash out at least half your winnings and put them in your pocket. If you started with $50 and you're at $75, pocket $25 and play with the original $50. <strong>Playing for 2+ hours straight?</strong> Take a mandatory break. Walk around, get food, hydrate. Your decision-making gets worse the longer you play. <strong>Feeling frustrated or emotional?</strong> Stop immediately. Angry gambling is how people lose their entire budget in 20 minutes. <strong>Never borrow money to gamble.</strong> Not from friends, not from ATMs (casino ATMs charge $5-$8 fees), not from anyone. When your budget is gone, it's gone. Go enjoy the 100 other things Vegas has to offer.</p>

              <p>Vegas is surprisingly affordable for college students. Off-strip hotels can cost as little as $30-$60 per night when split 4 ways, making it $8-$15 per person. Food ranges from $1 tacos on Fremont Street to $25 all-you-can-eat buffets at Bacchanal Buffet. Many shows have student rush tickets for $30-$50, and the Bellagio fountains, Fremont Street light show, and people-watching are completely free. A full 3-5 day trip can be done for $600-$800 per person on a tight budget.</p>

Some clubs offer free entry for women on guest lists, while guys typically pay $20-$50 cover. Sign up for guest lists online 1-2 days before to skip lines and get reduced or free entry.

              <p>Gambling can be fun as entertainment, but set a strict budget and treat it as the cost of the experience, not a way to make money. A reasonable gambling budget for a college student is $50-$100 for the entire trip. Stick to low-stakes games like $5-$10 blackjack tables (available at Casino Royale on the Strip), penny slots, or low-buy-in poker tournaments ($40-$65 at places like Aria or The Orleans).

              <p>The absolute cheapest way is to drive from LA or Phoenix and split gas 4 ways -- that's only $15-25 per person for the entire trip. If you're flying, Spirit and Frontier run flights from major cities for $60-120 round trip if you book 3-4 weeks in advance and fly midweek. Megabus runs from LA to Vegas and tickets sometimes drop to $15 one-way if you book early. FlixBus also offers student discounts and routes from multiple California cities for $20-40. If you're a larger group, renting a minivan and splitting the cost can be cheaper than individual flights. Check Google Flights with flexible dates -- Tuesday and Wednesday departures are consistently the cheapest.</p>

              <p>You must be 21 to gamble, drink, and enter most nightclubs in Vegas. However, if you're 18-20, there's still plenty to do. You can attend some pool parties that are 18+ (check each venue's age policy individually -- Marquee Dayclub sometimes has 18+ events). You can see shows, eat at every restaurant, shop, walk the Strip, visit Fremont Street, go to Red Rock Canyon, see Seven Magic Mountains, ride the High Roller, visit museums like the Mob Museum and Neon Museum, and enjoy all the free attractions. Some bars and lounges are 21+ only while others allow 18+ entry without alcohol service. Always check the specific venue's age policy before making plans. Bring a valid government-issued ID regardless of your age.</p>

              <p>For a 3-day trip, budget $300-500 for food, drinks, and activities on top of your hotel and transportation costs. For a 5-day trip, plan for $500-800. Your gambling budget should be completely separate -- only bring cash you're 100% OK losing, whether that's $50 or $200. The biggest money saver is pre-gaming in your hotel room before going out. Drinks on the Strip are $15-20 each, but a handle of liquor from a nearby CVS or Total Wine is $15-25 and lasts the whole trip. Buy a case of water bottles ($4) and snacks for the room. Use the free drink strategy while gambling (tip servers $1-2 per drink). Eat cheap for most meals and do one big splurge. You can absolutely do Vegas on $100/day if you're strategic.</p>

              <span>Is it better to go to Vegas on a weekday or weekend?</span>
              <svg class="faq-chevron" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2"><polyline points="6 9 12 15 18 9"></polyline></svg>

            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>Both have pros and cons. <strong>Weekdays (Sun-Thu):</strong> Hotels are 40-60% cheaper, pools are less crowded, table minimums are lower ($5-10 vs $15-25), restaurants are easier to get into, and everything feels more relaxed. <strong>Weekends (Fri-Sat):</strong> Better DJ lineups at pool parties and clubs, more energy and bigger crowds everywhere, bigger pool parties, and the Strip has peak "Vegas energy." The sweet spot for college students: arrive Thursday afternoon and leave Sunday morning. You get one cheap weeknight for hotel rates, the full Friday-Saturday weekend energy, and you're home in time to recover before Monday classes. Thursday arrival also lets you explore the Strip at a more relaxed pace before the weekend crowds hit.</p>

            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>Walk. Seriously -- the Strip is 4.2 miles end to end, but on any given night you'll only cover 1-2 miles between casinos. Wear comfortable shoes (this is the #1 Vegas tip nobody follows). For longer distances: the Las Vegas Monorail runs along the east side of the Strip for $5 per ride or $13 for an all-day pass. Uber and Lyft cost $8-15 between Strip locations (surge pricing applies after midnight on weekends). The Deuce bus runs the full length of the Strip for a $6 all-day pass and operates 24/7 -- great value. NEVER take a taxi in Vegas. They're more expensive than rideshares, some take intentionally long routes, and the pickup lines at hotels are brutal. For getting to downtown Fremont Street from the Strip, Uber/Lyft is $12-18 or the Deuce bus is included in your day pass.</p>

              <span>Are Vegas shows worth it for college students?</span>

            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>Absolutely yes -- but only if you get discount tickets. Full-price Vegas shows ($100-200) aren't worth it on a student budget, but at 50% off they're incredible experiences. Here's how: check TodayTix app and Tix4Tonight booths on the Strip for same-day tickets at 25-50% off. Student rush tickets are available at many box offices 1-2 hours before showtime with a valid student ID ($30-60). Cirque du Soleil shows start from $60 on weeknights, comedy shows from $30, and magic shows from $20. The #1 student recommendation is Absinthe at Caesars Palace -- it's a raunchy, hilarious circus-style show in an intimate tent setting that's unlike anything you've ever seen. Weeknight shows are significantly cheaper than Friday/Saturday performances across the board.</p>
