Food ranges from $1 tacos on Fremont Street to $25 all-you-can-eat buffets at Bacchanal Buffet. Many shows have student rush tickets for $30-$50, and the Bellagio fountains, Fremont Street light show, and people-watching are completely free.

Most major nightclubs on the Strip (like Hakkasan at MGM Grand, Omnia at Caesars, and XS at Encore) require you to be 21+ with a valid ID. Some clubs offer free entry for women on guest lists, while guys typically pay $20-$50 cover. Sign up for guest lists online 1-2 days before to skip lines and get reduced or free entry.

The LA-to-Vegas route is the most iconic and is the one featured in movies like The Hangover and Swingers.

A reasonable gambling budget for a college student is $50-$100 for the entire trip. Stick to low-stakes games like $5-$10 blackjack tables (available at places like Casino Royale on the Strip), penny slots, or low-buy-in poker tournaments ($40-$65 at places like Aria or The Orleans). Never gamble money you can't afford to lose, and walk away when you hit your limit."

Major pool parties like Encore Beach Club and Wet Republic at MGM Grand open for the season in March. Avoid July and August if you can't handle extreme heat (110°F+). Spring break (mid-March) and Memorial Day weekend are the biggest party weekends. Tickets range from $20-$75 for general admission, with prices higher on weekends and holidays."

            <h3 class="tip-card-title">Surprisingly Affordable</h3>
            <p class="tip-card-text">Split a hotel room 4 ways and you're paying $15-$25 per person per night -- even on the Strip. Off-strip hotels like The Orleans or Palace Station can be under $40/night total. Add in $5 meals at Tacos El Gordo and free attractions like the Bellagio fountains, and Vegas is legitimately one of the cheapest trips you can take.</p>

            <p class="tip-card-text">Cirque du Soleil, headliner residencies, comedy shows, magic acts -- Vegas has more entertainment per square mile than anywhere on Earth. Student rush tickets can get you into major shows for $30-$50. Plus, free shows like the Bellagio fountains and the Fremont Street Experience run all night long.</p>

            <p class="tip-card-text">From the legendary Bacchanal Buffet at Caesars to hidden gems like Secret Pizza inside the Cosmopolitan, Vegas has food for every budget. Hit In-N-Out on the Strip for a $5 meal, explore Chinatown for incredible ramen and dim sum under $15, or splurge on a Gordon Ramsay burger. Your taste buds will thank you.</p>

            <p class="tip-card-text">Vegas invented the daytime pool party, and it's a college student's dream. Encore Beach Club, Wet Republic at MGM Grand, and Marquee Dayclub turn resort pools into open-air nightclubs with world-class DJs. General admission starts around $20-$40, and the vibes are absolutely unmatched from noon to sunset.</p>

            <p class="tip-card-text">The LA-to-Vegas drive through the Mojave Desert is a movie scene come to life. Four hours of open road, desert landscapes, and the moment you first see the Vegas skyline rising from the sand. Stop at Seven Magic Mountains for photos, grab In-N-Out in Barstow, and crank the playlist. The road trip IS the experience.</p>

            <p class="tip-card-text">There's a reason "what happens in Vegas" became the most quoted travel phrase in history. Whether it's winning $200 at blackjack, seeing a surprise celebrity DJ set, accidentally ending up at a 4am buffet, or watching the sunrise from the top of a parking garage -- Vegas creates stories you'll tell at every reunion for the rest of your life.</p>

            <h3 class="tip-card-title">How to Eat Cheap in Vegas</h3>
            <p class="tip-card-text">Skip the overpriced hotel restaurants and hit these spots: Tacos El Gordo on the Strip ($3-$5 tacos), Secret Pizza at the Cosmopolitan ($6 slices), In-N-Out right on the Strip ($5 combo), and Chinatown's Spring Mountain Road for $10-$15 meals that rival any expensive restaurant. For breakfast, Earl of Sandwich at Planet Hollywood does killer $7 breakfast sandwiches. And never underestimate a good CVS grocery run for water, snacks, and drinks to keep in the hotel room.</p>

            <h3 class="tip-card-title">Pool Party Hacks</h3>
            <p class="tip-card-text">Get on the guest list 1-2 days before through promoter Instagram accounts or sites like NoWaitList. Women often get free entry on weekdays with guest lists; guys pay $20-$30 instead of $50+. Go early (gates open at 11am) to get a good spot. Bring a waterproof phone case. Pre-game before because drinks inside are $15-$20 each. Eat a big meal beforehand -- you'll be in the sun for hours. And sunscreen is non-negotiable -- the Vegas desert sun at a pool party will destroy you.</p>

            <h3 class="tip-card-title">Gambling Tips for Beginners</h3>
            <p class="tip-card-text">Rule number one: set a strict budget and put it in a separate pocket or envelope. When it's gone, it's gone. Start with $5-$10 blackjack tables at Casino Royale (cheapest on the Strip). Learn basic blackjack strategy before you go -- it reduces the house edge to under 1%. Avoid slot machines (highest house edge). Try craps -- it looks intimidating but the "pass line" bet is one of the best odds in the casino. And remember: the house always wins long-term. Treat gambling as entertainment, not income.</p>

            <h3 class="tip-card-title">Best Free Things in Vegas</h3>
            <p class="tip-card-text">Vegas has an incredible amount of free entertainment. The Bellagio fountains (every 15-30 min) never get old. The Fremont Street Experience light show runs hourly after dark. Walk through the Bellagio Conservatory botanical gardens, which change with the seasons. See the flamingos (real ones!) at the Flamingo Wildlife Habitat. Watch the Mirage volcano erupt at night. Check out the Fall of Atlantis show at the Forum Shops. And people-watching on the Strip is honestly some of the best free entertainment on Earth.</p>

            <h3 class="tip-card-title">Staying Hydrated in the Desert</h3>
            <p class="tip-card-text">This is not a joke -- Vegas is in the middle of the Mojave Desert and dehydration sneaks up fast, especially if you're drinking alcohol and spending time at pool parties. Buy a case of water bottles from CVS or Walgreens ($4 for a 24-pack) and keep them in your hotel room. Drink at least one bottle of water for every alcoholic drink. Carry a reusable water bottle everywhere. If you start getting headaches or feeling dizzy, you're already dehydrated. The free water you can get while gambling at tables is a bonus hydration strategy.</p>

            <h3 class="tip-card-title">Splitting Costs with Friends</h3>
            <p class="tip-card-text">Vegas is built for group travel. Use Splitwise or Venmo to track expenses in real time -- nothing kills a friendship faster than arguing about money on the last day. Split the hotel room 4 ways (even 3 beds + 1 pullout works for one trip). Rent one car instead of multiple Ubers. Buy bulk snacks and drinks from a grocery store together. For restaurants, ask for separate checks upfront. Designate one person as the "trip treasurer" who books everything and gets reimbursed. It keeps things organized and drama-free.</p>

            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>Vegas is surprisingly affordable for college students. Off-strip hotels can cost as little as $30-$60 per night when split 4 ways, making it $8-$15 per person. Food ranges from $1 tacos on Fremont Street to $25 all-you-can-eat buffets at Bacchanal Buffet. Many shows have student rush tickets for $30-$50, and the Bellagio fountains, Fremont Street light show, and people-watching are completely free. A full 3-5 day trip can be done for $600-$800 per person on a tight budget.</p>

              <p>The best budget hotels for college students include The LINQ (mid-Strip location, often $50-$80/night), Excalibur (south Strip, $40-$60/night), Circus Circus (north Strip, $30-$50/night), and off-strip options like Palace Station or The Orleans ($25-$45/night). Split a room 4 ways and you're paying $10-$20 per person per night. Book midweek for the lowest rates, and check for student deals on booking platforms.</p>

            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>Yes, 21 is the legal age for clubs and bars in Vegas. Most major nightclubs on the Strip like Hakkasan at MGM Grand, Omnia at Caesars, and XS at Encore require 21+ with valid ID. Some clubs offer free entry for women on guest lists, while guys typically pay $20-$50 cover. Sign up for guest lists online 1-2 days before to skip lines and get reduced or free entry. Pool parties at Encore Beach Club and Wet Republic also require 21+ ID.</p>

              <p>The most popular road trip routes to Vegas include: from Los Angeles (4 hours via I-15, the classic route with a stop at the Barstow outlets), from Phoenix (4.5 hours via US-93 through stunning desert landscape and Hoover Dam), from San Diego (5 hours via I-15), and from San Francisco (8 hours via I-5 to I-15). The LA-to-Vegas route is the most iconic and featured in movies like The Hangover and Swingers. Pro tip: leave early to avoid traffic and stop at Seven Magic Mountains for Instagram photos.</p>

              <p>Gambling can be fun as entertainment, but set a strict budget and treat it as the cost of the experience, not a way to make money. A reasonable gambling budget for a college student is $50-$100 for the entire trip. Stick to low-stakes games like $5-$10 blackjack tables (available at Casino Royale on the Strip), penny slots, or low-buy-in poker tournaments ($40-$65 at places like Aria or The Orleans). Never gamble money you can't afford to lose, and walk away when you hit your limit.</p>

              <p>Pool party season in Vegas runs from March through October, with the peak season being April through September. The best months are April, May, and September when temperatures are hot but not extreme (85-100&#176;F). Major pool parties like Encore Beach Club and Wet Republic at MGM Grand open for the season in March. Avoid July and August if you can't handle extreme heat (110&#176;F+). Spring break (mid-March) and Memorial Day weekend are the biggest party weekends. Tickets range from $20-$75 for general admission, with prices higher on weekends and holidays.</p>
