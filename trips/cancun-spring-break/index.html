Early April works too but you'll miss the peak spring break energy. Book by November-December for the best deals on flights and all-inclusive packages."

Stick to the Hotel Zone and well-known areas, use the buddy system at night, only take official taxis or Uber, keep valuables in your hotel safe, and don't accept drinks from strangers. Cancun sees over 30,000 college students during spring break season and the tourism infrastructure is built to keep visitors safe."

An all-inclusive resort includes unlimited food, drinks (alcoholic and non-alcoholic), pool access, beach access, and often entertainment for one flat price of $100-$250/night per person. A regular hotel might be $60-$100/night but you'll spend $50-$100/day on food and drinks anyway. All-inclusive also means no surprise charges and easier budgeting. Popular all-inclusive options for college groups include Oasis Cancun Lite, Grand Oasis Cancun, Temptation Resort, and Hotel Riu Cancun."

Avoid going after mid-April when the spring break crowds thin out and the heat ramps up. Weather from February through March is ideal: 80-88°F, low humidity, and sunny skies."

The sweet spot: book a mid-range hotel with breakfast included, eat street food for lunch ($5-$10), and splurge on dinner. This hybrid approach costs $60-$90/day vs $120-$200+ for all-inclusive, and you'll eat better food and see more of real Cancun."

Your passport must be valid for at least 6 months beyond your travel dates. Standard processing takes 6-8 weeks so apply at least 2 months before your trip. Expedited processing is available for an additional $60 and takes 2-3 weeks. You'll also receive a tourist card (FMM) on the plane or at immigration -- keep it safe as you need it to leave Mexico."

          <h2 class="section-title">Movies & Culture That Made <span class="gradient-text">Cancun Legendary</span></h2>
          <p class="section-desc">Cancun didn't become the ultimate spring break destination by accident. Decades of movies, TV shows, and pop culture cemented its reputation as THE place to be when classes let out. Here's what put it on the map.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="seen-in-grid">

            <h3 class="seen-in-title">Spring Breakers</h3>
            <p class="seen-in-year">2012</p>
            <p class="seen-in-desc">Harmony Korine's neon-soaked fever dream starring Selena Gomez, Vanessa Hudgens, and James Franco became the defining visual of modern spring break culture. The film's sun-drenched party scenes and "Spring break forever" mantra turned Cancun's beach party aesthetic into an entire cultural moment that still dominates Instagram every March.</p>

            <p class="seen-in-year">2003</p>
            <p class="seen-in-desc">The first-ever reality movie dropped 16 strangers into an all-inclusive Cancun resort and filmed every chaotic minute. Before TikTok, before Instagram, this film showed America exactly what spring break in Cancun looked like -- and millions of college students immediately started planning their own trips. It basically invented the spring break content genre.</p>

            <p class="seen-in-year">1986-2005</p>
            <p class="seen-in-desc">For nearly two decades, MTV broadcast live from Cancun's beaches, turning the Hotel Zone into the most famous party strip on the planet. Carson Daly, Jenny McCarthy, and a revolving cast of hosts brought concerts, contests, and absolute chaos to millions of living rooms. MTV single-handedly made Cancun synonymous with college spring break in America.</p>

            <p class="seen-in-year">2008</p>
            <p class="seen-in-desc">Matthew McConaughey and Kate Hudson's treasure-hunting adventure showcased the stunning Caribbean waters off Mexico's coast. While technically set in the Florida Keys and Bahamas, many scenes highlighted the exact turquoise waters and white sand beaches that make the Yucatan Peninsula irresistible. It made everyone want to grab a snorkel and jump into crystal-clear Mexican waters.</p>

            <p class="seen-in-desc">This surf-culture sequel followed a young woman chasing waves across stunning Caribbean coastlines. The film's gorgeous underwater cinematography and beach lifestyle scenes made the Yucatan's coastline look absolutely unreal. It inspired a generation of adventure-seeking college women to add water sports and beach exploration to their Cancun itineraries beyond just the pool parties.</p>

          <h2 class="section-title">Why Cancun Is <span class="gradient-text">THE Spring Break Destination</span></h2>
          <p class="section-desc">Over 100,000 college students descend on Cancun every spring break season. Here's exactly why it dominates every other destination and why your squad needs to be there.</p>

            <div class="tip-card-icon">&#127864;</div>
            <h3 class="tip-card-title">All-Inclusive Culture</h3>
            <p class="tip-card-text">Cancun practically invented the all-inclusive spring break. For one flat price you get unlimited food, unlimited drinks (yes, alcoholic), pool access, beach chairs, entertainment, and often nightclub deals. No mental math. No splitting checks. No budgeting stress. Just wristband on, brain off, and enjoy everything without reaching for your wallet. Resorts like Oasis Cancun Lite, Grand Oasis, and Temptation Resort are built specifically for the college crowd with foam parties, DJ pools, and organized events all day long.</p>

            <div class="tip-card-icon">&#9992;</div>
            <h3 class="tip-card-title">Direct Flights from Everywhere</h3>
            <p class="tip-card-text">Cancun International Airport (CUN) has direct flights from virtually every major US city. You can fly from New York, LA, Chicago, Dallas, Miami, Atlanta, Denver, and dozens more with flight times ranging from just 2 to 5 hours. Airlines like Spirit, Frontier, JetBlue, Southwest, and American all compete for spring break travelers, which means deals as low as $150-$300 round trip if you book early. It's literally one of the cheapest international flights you can take from the US.</p>

          <div class="tip-card fade-in">
            <div class="tip-card-icon">&#127866;</div>
            <h3 class="tip-card-title">Drinking Age is 18</h3>
            <p class="tip-card-text">Let's be honest -- this is a huge draw. Mexico's legal drinking age is 18, which means every single college student can legally enjoy the open bar at their all-inclusive, hit the clubs in the Party Center, and order margaritas on the beach without fake IDs or sketchy situations. Freshmen, sophomores, juniors, seniors -- everyone's in. Just bring your passport or a valid photo ID and you're golden. This alone makes Cancun more accessible than any US spring break destination.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="tip-card fade-in">
            <div class="tip-card-icon">&#127754;</div>
            <h3 class="tip-card-title">World-Class Beaches</h3>
            <p class="tip-card-text">Cancun's beaches aren't just nice -- they're consistently ranked among the best in the entire world. We're talking powdery white sand that squeaks under your feet and water so turquoise it looks photoshopped. The Hotel Zone sits on a narrow strip between the Caribbean Sea and the Nichupte Lagoon, meaning you're surrounded by water on both sides. Playa Delfines, Playa Forum, Playa Tortugas, and Playa Chac Mool are all stunners. The beach content alone will carry your Instagram for the next six months.</p>

            <h3 class="tip-card-title">Legendary Nightlife</h3>
            <p class="tip-card-text">Cancun's Party Center (also called the Hotel Zone nightlife strip) is one of the most concentrated nightlife districts in the Western Hemisphere. Coco Bongo is a multi-level show club with acrobats, confetti cannons, and celebrity impersonators. The City holds 5,000+ people and hosts world-class DJs. Mandala, La Vaquita, Palazzo, and Señor Frog's keep the energy going every single night. Most clubs include open bar with your cover charge ($40-$80). The party doesn't even start until midnight and goes until sunrise.</p>

            <h3 class="tip-card-title">Tourist-Friendly & Safe</h3>
            <p class="tip-card-text">Cancun's entire Hotel Zone was purpose-built for international tourism. The 14-mile strip is heavily patrolled by dedicated tourism police, resorts have 24/7 security, and the local economy depends on keeping visitors safe and happy. You'll find English spoken everywhere, US dollars accepted at most places, and ATMs on every corner. Over 6 million tourists visit Cancun annually and the infrastructure is world-class. Stick to the Hotel Zone and tourist areas and you'll feel as safe as any major US city.</p>

          <p class="pro-tip-text">Here's a secret the travel industry won't tell you: budget spring breakers almost always come home with BETTER stories. When you're navigating public buses, bargaining at taco stands, meeting strangers at hostels, and figuring things out on the fly, you're creating the kind of chaotic, hilarious memories that you'll still be laughing about at your 10-year reunion. The baller version is amazing and comfortable, but the budget version builds character and friendships. Either way, you're in Cancun -- you literally can't lose.</p>

          <p class="section-desc">Cancun has options for every budget and every vibe. From $25/night hostel dorms to $250/night luxury all-inclusives, here are the six best accommodation strategies for college spring breakers in 2026.</p>

              <h3 class="dest-card-title">&#127878; Grand Oasis Cancun</h3>
              <p class="dest-card-subtitle">From $120/night all-inclusive</p>
              <p class="dest-card-desc"><strong>The Vibe:</strong> This is THE college party resort in Cancun. Grand Oasis is purpose-built for spring breakers with 3 massive pools, daily foam parties, live DJs from noon to midnight, bikini contests, and an on-site nightclub. The all-inclusive wristband covers unlimited food at 12 restaurants, unlimited drinks at 15 bars, and access to all pool and beach events. It's essentially a self-contained spring break city.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-desc"><strong>Best For:</strong> Groups who want the classic all-inclusive spring break experience with zero planning. Everything is included and the energy is non-stop from check-in to checkout.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-desc"><strong>Pros:</strong> All-inclusive eliminates budgeting stress. Massive property with tons of options. Right in the Hotel Zone. Spring break programming is top-tier. On-site nightclub means no taxi costs some nights.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-desc"><strong>Cons:</strong> Can feel overwhelming and crowded during peak weeks. Room quality varies -- request a renovated room. Food is quantity over quality. You're in a spring break bubble and won't experience "real" Cancun.</p>

            <div class="dest-card-body">
              <h3 class="dest-card-title">&#127758; Hostel Mundo Joven Cancun</h3>
              <p class="dest-card-subtitle">From $25/night (dorm bed)</p>
              <p class="dest-card-desc"><strong>The Vibe:</strong> The backpacker's base camp. Mundo Joven is a social hostel in downtown Cancun with mixed and female-only dorm rooms, a rooftop bar, pool table, communal kitchen, and organized bar crawl meetups every night during spring break. You'll share a room with 4-8 travelers from around the world and make instant friends over cheap beers on the rooftop. The hostel organizes group trips to cenotes, Isla Mujeres, and Chichen Itza at discounted rates.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-desc"><strong>Best For:</strong> Solo travelers, social butterflies, and anyone who values meeting new people over resort luxury. Also great for budget travelers who'd rather spend money on experiences than a hotel room.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-desc"><strong>Pros:</strong> Incredibly cheap. Built-in social scene. Organized activities and bar crawls. Kitchen saves money on food. Authentic downtown location near amazing local restaurants.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-desc"><strong>Cons:</strong> Downtown location means a 20-minute bus ride to the Hotel Zone beaches and clubs. Dorm rooms mean less privacy and potential noise. No beach access on-site. Need to take the R-1 bus or Uber to nightlife.</p>

              <h3 class="dest-card-title">&#128187; Selina Cancun Downtown</h3>
              <p class="dest-card-subtitle">From $60/night (private room)</p>
              <p class="dest-card-desc"><strong>The Vibe:</strong> Where digital nomad culture meets spring break energy. Selina is a trendy boutique hostel/hotel hybrid with co-working spaces, a pool, yoga classes, a bar, and curated social events. The rooms range from dorm beds ($30/night) to private rooms ($60-$90/night) with modern, Instagram-worthy design. The crowd skews slightly older and more international -- gap year travelers, remote workers, and adventurous college students who want more than just pool parties.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-desc"><strong>Best For:</strong> Students who want a social atmosphere with a design-forward aesthetic. Great for small groups of 2-3 who want private rooms without resort prices. Perfect if you're combining spring break with remote coursework or freelance projects.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-desc"><strong>Pros:</strong> Stylish and clean. Great pool and bar scene. Co-working space if you need to cram for midterms (it happens). Organized day trips and social events. More curated crowd.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-desc"><strong>Cons:</strong> Downtown location, not beachfront. Smaller property means it can sell out fast. Not a rager atmosphere -- if you want non-stop party energy, Grand Oasis is a better fit. Restaurant options on-site are pricier than street food.</p>

              <h3 class="dest-card-title">&#127968; Airbnb in Hotel Zone</h3>
              <p class="dest-card-subtitle">$30-$50/person/night (split 4-6 ways)</p>
              <p class="dest-card-desc"><strong>The Vibe:</strong> The move for large groups. Rent a 2-3 bedroom condo in the Hotel Zone and split it 4-6 ways. You get a full kitchen (breakfast savings are huge), a living room for pregaming, a balcony with lagoon or ocean views, and often access to the building's pool and gym. You're right in the Hotel Zone within walking distance of beaches, clubs, and restaurants, but you have your own private space to retreat to.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-desc"><strong>Best For:</strong> Groups of 4-6 friends who want Hotel Zone location at budget prices. Ideal for groups with mixed budgets -- the frugal friend and the big spender can both be happy when the base cost is this low.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-desc"><strong>Pros:</strong> Best value per person in the Hotel Zone. Kitchen saves $20-$40/day on food. Private space for the group. No resort crowds. Walking distance to everything. More authentic living experience.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-desc"><strong>Cons:</strong> No all-inclusive perks -- you're buying all food and drinks separately. No organized activities or pool parties. Need to self-organize everything. Quality varies wildly -- read reviews carefully and book Superhosts only. Cleaning fees can add up.</p>

              <h3 class="dest-card-title">&#9992; All-Inclusive Packages</h3>
              <p class="dest-card-subtitle">From $799 with flights included</p>
              <p class="dest-card-desc"><strong>The Vibe:</strong> The "I don't want to think about anything" option. StudentUniverse, CheapCaribbean, and Apple Vacations offer bundled packages that include round-trip flights from major US hubs (JFK, LAX, ORD, DFW, MIA, ATL), 5-6 nights at an all-inclusive resort, airport transfers, and sometimes excursion credits. You pay one price, get a confirmation email, and show up at the airport. That's it. Everything else is handled.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-desc"><strong>Best For:</strong> First-time international travelers, groups who want zero logistical stress, and anyone who wants to lock in a fixed budget with no surprises. Also great for students who don't have time to research flights, hotels, and transfers separately.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-desc"><strong>Pros:</strong> One price covers everything. No booking 5 different things on 5 different sites. Often cheaper than booking flight + hotel separately. Student-specific platforms offer age-verified deals. Group rates available for 6+ people.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-desc"><strong>Cons:</strong> Less flexibility on dates and hotel choice. You get what's in the package -- upgrades cost extra. Peak spring break weeks sell out fast. Cheapest packages may fly out of inconvenient airports or at odd hours. Read the fine print on what's actually "included."</p>

              <h3 class="dest-card-title">&#127961; Downtown Cancun Hotels</h3>
              <p class="dest-card-subtitle">From $40/night</p>
              <p class="dest-card-desc"><strong>The Vibe:</strong> The off-the-beaten-path play. Downtown Cancun (El Centro) is where locals live, eat, and hang out. Hotels here are significantly cheaper than the Hotel Zone, and you're surrounded by authentic Mexican restaurants, panaderias, street food stalls, and Parque de las Palapas -- a lively public square with live music and food vendors every evening. It's the "real Mexico" experience that most spring breakers completely miss.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-desc"><strong>Best For:</strong> Budget travelers, culture seekers, and students who want to experience Mexico beyond the resort bubble. Great for foodies -- the best and cheapest Mexican food in Cancun is downtown, not in the Hotel Zone.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-desc"><strong>Pros:</strong> 50-70% cheaper than Hotel Zone hotels. Incredible authentic food within walking distance (tacos al pastor for $1, tortas for $3, fresh jugos for $2). Feels like real Mexico. R-1 bus to Hotel Zone beaches takes 20 minutes and costs $0.70.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-desc"><strong>Cons:</strong> 20-30 minutes from Hotel Zone beaches and nightlife by bus or Uber. No beach access on-site. Less English spoken (bring Google Translate). Uber rides to nightlife add $5-$10 each way. You'll need to be more independent and adventurous.</p>

        <div class="pro-tip fade-in">
          <div class="pro-tip-label">&#128161; Pro Tip</div>
          <p class="pro-tip-text">The smartest move for groups of 4-6: book an Airbnb in the Hotel Zone for your base, then buy a 1-day pass to Grand Oasis or another all-inclusive resort ($60-$80 for a day pass). You get the best of both worlds -- cheap accommodations with a kitchen AND one epic all-inclusive pool party day. Some resorts sell "spring break day passes" that include open bar, food, pool, and beach access. Call ahead or check their website for day pass availability.</p>

It's casual, fun, and the perfect way to break the ice with your crew. Expect yard-long drinks, body shots, and dancing on tables. Cover is usually free or $20-$30 with open bar.</span>

Grab lunch at one of Xcaret's included restaurants if you booked the Plus package ($130-$150). The park has a tequila tasting area too -- because you're in Mexico and it would be rude not to.</span>

            <h3 class="itinerary-day-title">Isla Mujeres Catamaran Party</h3>
            <p class="itinerary-day-desc">One of the absolute highlights of any Cancun trip. Board a catamaran, sail across the Caribbean to the gorgeous Isla Mujeres, and experience the best boat party of your college career. This day alone is worth the entire trip.</p>

                <span>Book the Isla Mujeres catamaran party tour ($60-$90 per person, includes open bar and lunch). Depart from Playa Tortugas or your tour pickup point around 9 AM. The catamaran ride itself is a party -- DJ, dancing, open bar starts immediately, and the views of the Cancun skyline from the water are absolutely fire. You'll stop for snorkeling at the El Farito reef where you can swim with tropical fish and sea turtles.</span>

If you still have energy, hit up Mandala or Palazzo for a more upscale club experience compared to the Coco Bongo chaos.</span>

            <p class="itinerary-day-desc">Today you're seeing one of the New Seven Wonders of the World. Yes, really. Chichen Itza is a 2.5-hour drive from Cancun but absolutely worth the early wake-up call. You'll also swim in an ancient cenote -- a natural sinkhole sacred to the Maya.</p>

Arrive at Chichen Itza early to beat the crowds and the heat. Stand before the massive El Castillo pyramid (Kukulkan) and listen to your guide explain how the ancient Maya built this astronomical marvel over 1,000 years ago. Clap in front of the pyramid and hear the echo mimic the call of the quetzal bird. Mind = blown.</span>

Descend into a massive open-air cave and swim in crystal-clear turquoise water surrounded by hanging vines and roots. It looks like something out of a fantasy movie and the photos are absolutely unreal. Enjoy a buffet lunch of traditional Yucatecan food -- cochinita pibil (slow-roasted pork), handmade tortillas, and agua de horchata.</span>

Tonight try La Vaquita -- it's a loud, rowdy, hilarious party bar with foam parties, body paint, and DJs spinning reggaeton and EDM. The cover is around $40-$50 with open bar and the vibe is pure chaos in the best possible way. Or honestly, hit the resort hot tub and call it a night -- no judgment.</span>

Roll into the breakfast buffet at 10 AM, load up on huevos rancheros and fresh-squeezed orange juice, and park yourself by the pool. Many resorts run their biggest pool parties of the week on Saturdays -- foam machines, DJs, drink specials, limbo contests, and belly flop competitions. Enter everything. Win nothing.

Take your final sunset photos, do some last-minute souvenir shopping at the Forum by the Sea mall (tequila bottles, Mexican blankets, funny spring break t-shirts), and grab your last beachside margarita. Hit the resort spa if your all-inclusive includes it -- a massage after a week of partying is chef's kiss.</span>

Multiple levels, world-class DJs, insane light shows, and an energy level that's hard to describe. Spring break nights here are absolutely electric. Cover is $50-$70 with open bar. Make friends with strangers, dance until 4 AM, and soak in every last second of your Cancun spring break. This is the night you'll talk about for years.</span>

          <p class="pro-tip-text">Book your Cancun spring break package in November or early December for the best deals -- prices can be 20-30% cheaper than booking in January or February. Also, the second and third weeks of March are peak spring break weeks with the biggest crowds and best party atmosphere. If you want a slightly cheaper, less chaotic experience, go the last week of February or first week of April. Group bookings of 6+ people often unlock additional discounts at all-inclusive resorts.</p>

Many tour companies offer "cenote hopping" tours that hit 3-4 cenotes in one day for $60-$80 including transport and lunch. Bring reef-safe sunscreen -- it's required by law at cenotes.

The views are absolutely unreal -- ancient stone temples perched on a bluff with turquoise water crashing below. The site is compact and walkable in about 90 minutes. The main structure, El Castillo, is the most photographed ruin in the Yucatan. After exploring the ruins, walk down the cliff path to the beach below and swim in the shadow of a 700-year-old civilization. Combine this with a cenote stop and Playa del Carmen visit for a packed day trip. Arrive early (gates open at 8 AM) to beat the tour bus crowds that arrive around 10 AM.

Fifth Avenue (Quinta Avenida) is a pedestrian-only shopping and dining street stretching 20+ blocks with boutique shops, restaurants, bars, and street performers. The beach is gorgeous and less crowded than Hotel Zone beaches. Nightlife on 12th Street rivals Cancun's Party Center but with a more local, less touristy feel. Clubs and bars here are generally cheaper -- $20-$30 covers with open bar instead of $50-$80 in Cancun. It's also the jumping-off point for the Cozumel ferry if you want to add a dive island to your trip. Great as a half-day trip combined with Tulum or cenotes, or as a full chill day away from the Hotel Zone madness.</p>

          <p class="pro-tip-text">Don't try to cram every excursion into your trip. Pick 2-3 day trips max and leave the rest for beach and pool days. The biggest mistake spring breakers make is over-scheduling and burning out by Day 4. A solid mix: one adventure day (Xcaret or cenotes), one culture day (Chichen Itza or Tulum), and one island day (Isla Mujeres). Book excursions through Viator or GetYourGuide for verified reviews and free cancellation -- not from the random guys selling tours on the beach.</p>

          <p class="section-desc">Cancun's Party Center in the Hotel Zone is one of the most concentrated nightlife strips on Earth. Every major club is within walking distance of each other. Here are the six venues you need to know, ranked by vibe, with real prices and insider tips that'll save you money and maximize your nights out.</p>

              <p class="dest-card-subtitle">$80 open bar &bull; MUST DO &bull; Show + Nightclub</p>
              <p class="dest-card-desc"><strong>The Experience:</strong> This isn't just a club -- it's a full-blown theatrical experience combined with the most intense nightclub you've ever been in. Acrobats fly over the crowd on wires performing Cirque du Soleil-level stunts. Confetti cannons blast every 20 minutes. Celebrity impersonators perform as Michael Jackson, Beyonc&#233;, Spider-Man, and The Beatles while you dance below. Giant balloons drop from the ceiling. LED screens flash synchronized visuals. It's sensory overload in the best way possible.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-desc"><strong>Music:</strong> Everything -- Top 40, reggaeton, EDM, hip-hop, rock classics, Latin. The DJ switches genres constantly to match the show acts.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-desc"><strong>Insider Tips:</strong> Buy your tickets online at cocobongo.com before you go -- walk-up prices are $10-$20 more and the line without pre-purchased tickets can be 45+ minutes. The Gold Member package ($80) includes open bar all night and is the standard choice. The Front Row VIP ($120) gets you a reserved table near the stage. Arrive by 10:30 PM to get a good spot. The shows start at 11:30 PM. This is the one club everyone MUST do at least once. Schedule it for your second or third night so you're warmed up but not burned out.</p>

              <p class="dest-card-desc"><strong>The Experience:</strong> A sleek, multi-level nightclub with a massive dance floor, world-class sound system, and a rooftop terrace where you can catch your breath and enjoy the Hotel Zone views between sets. Mandala is known for its foam parties (usually Wednesday and Saturday nights during spring break) where the entire dance floor fills with foam while you dance. The lighting and production are top-tier -- think Las Vegas meets Cancun. The crowd is a mix of college spring breakers, international tourists, and well-dressed locals.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-desc"><strong>Music:</strong> EDM, house, reggaeton, and hip-hop. DJs lean heavily into high-energy dance music with reggaeton drops that get the crowd going wild.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-desc"><strong>Insider Tips:</strong> Book the open bar package online for $50 instead of $60-$70 at the door. The rooftop terrace is the move when you need a breather -- great views and cooler temperature. Foam party nights are the most popular, so arrive early (11 PM) for those. Dress code is enforced -- no flip-flops, tank tops, or swim trunks. Mandala is directly across from Coco Bongo, so many people hit one venue early and hop to the other after midnight.</p>

              <p class="dest-card-desc"><strong>The Experience:</strong> With a capacity of 5,000 people, The City is one of the largest nightclubs in all of Latin America. Multiple levels, a massive main dance floor, VIP terrace areas, and a beach club extension make this venue feel absolutely enormous. During spring break, The City hosts themed nights, international DJ residencies, and special events that draw thousands of college students from across North America. The sound system is stadium-grade and the light shows are jaw-dropping -- lasers, pyrotechnics, LED walls, and CO2 cannons.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-desc"><strong>Music:</strong> Primarily EDM and hip-hop with dedicated room/area splits. The main room goes hard with electronic and dance music from internationally touring DJs. The upper levels tend toward hip-hop and reggaeton.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-desc"><strong>Insider Tips:</strong> This is the best venue for your big group night out because the capacity means you won't feel sardined even on the busiest nights. Open bar packages run $40-$60 depending on the night and how far in advance you buy. Check their Instagram (@thecitycancun) for spring break event lineups and special DJ announcements. VIP tables for groups of 6-8 can be surprisingly affordable when split ($50-$80 per person including bottles). Save The City for your last or second-to-last night for maximum send-off energy.</p>

              <h3 class="dest-card-title">&#127866; Se&#241;or Frog's</h3>
              <p class="dest-card-subtitle">Free-$30 entry &bull; Spring Break Institution</p>
              <p class="dest-card-desc"><strong>The Experience:</strong> If Cancun spring break had an official mascot, it would be the wild-eyed frog on this venue's logo. Se&#241;or Frog's is part restaurant, part bar, part absolute chaos machine. This is where you'll find yard-long drinks ($15-$20), body shot competitions on the bar, conga lines through the venue, waiters dancing on tables, and the general energy of a place that has zero interest in being classy. It starts as a dinner spot at 7 PM and transforms into a raging party by 10 PM. The vibes are unapologetically rowdy, cheesy, and incredibly fun.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-desc"><strong>Music:</strong> Party music wall-to-wall -- hip-hop, pop, reggaeton, party rock classics. The DJ takes requests and the MC keeps the energy at maximum with drinking games and crowd interactions.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-desc"><strong>Insider Tips:</strong> This is the perfect first-night venue. The energy is accessible, the drinks are strong, and the atmosphere is pure spring break nostalgia. Entry is often free or very cheap early in the evening -- show up for dinner around 8 PM and stay for the party. The yard-long drinks are shareable (and you'll want to share them). Buy the souvenir cup -- it's a classic spring break memento. Se&#241;or Frog's is best earlier in the evening (8 PM - midnight) before heading to a proper nightclub like Coco Bongo or The City for the late-night hours.</p>

            <div class="dest-card-body">
              <h3 class="dest-card-title">&#129313; La Vaquita</h3>
              <p class="dest-card-subtitle">$30 open bar deals &bull; Hilarious & Casual</p>
              <p class="dest-card-desc"><strong>The Experience:</strong> La Vaquita (literally "The Little Cow") is the club that doesn't take itself seriously and is infinitely better for it. The venue hands out ridiculous oversized costumes, hats, and props as you enter -- think giant sombreros, inflatable guitars, foam cowboy hats, and neon wigs. Everyone looks absolutely absurd and that's the entire point. The dance floor is packed, the drinks are strong, and the energy is pure group fun. It's the most "let loose" venue in the Party Center and perfect for groups who want to laugh as much as they dance.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-desc"><strong>Music:</strong> Reggaeton, hip-hop, Latin pop, and EDM. Heavy on the reggaeton and crowd-favorite party songs. The DJs know exactly what spring breakers want to hear.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-desc"><strong>Insider Tips:</strong> Buy the open bar deal online for $30-$35 instead of $40-$50 at the door (check their website or the Cancun Nightlife promoter booths on the strip). La Vaquita is the best venue for large groups because the costume/prop gimmick is a natural icebreaker and makes for hilarious group photos. The venue is right in the Party Center between Mandala and Coco Bongo, making it easy to club-hop. Best nights are Thursday and Saturday during spring break. No dress code -- come as you are, they'll dress you up anyway.</p>

              <h3 class="dest-card-title">&#127928; Dady'O</h3>
              <p class="dest-card-subtitle">$25 entry &bull; Less Touristy &bull; Rock + Electronic</p>
              <p class="dest-card-desc"><strong>The Experience:</strong> The OG of Cancun nightlife. Dady'O has been rocking the Hotel Zone since 1986 and has a rawer, more underground energy than the mega-clubs. Built inside a cave-like structure, the venue has an intimate, dark, sweaty atmosphere that feels more like a real nightclub and less like a tourist attraction. The crowd is a genuine mix of locals, international tourists, and college students, which gives it more authentic energy. Dady'O is where you go when you want to actually dance and lose yourself in the music instead of watching shows or wearing silly hats.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-desc"><strong>Music:</strong> Rock, electronic, EDM, indie dance, and Latin rock. The playlist is more eclectic and less formulaic than the bigger clubs. Some nights feature live DJs spinning deep house and techno.</p>
              <p class="dest-card-desc"><strong>Insider Tips:</strong> At $25 entry (sometimes with open bar during spring break promos), Dady'O is the most affordable club on the strip. It's directly across from Coco Bongo, so it's easy to do both in one night. The cave-like interior means it gets HOT -- dress light and hydrate. Wednesday nights during spring break are legendary with special events and discounted entry. This is the best pick for music lovers who find Coco Bongo too chaotic and La Vaquita too silly. If your group has that one friend who's "not really into clubs," bring them here -- the energy is different and they'll probably love it.</p>

          <div class="pro-tip-label">&#128161; Pro Tip</div>
          <p class="pro-tip-text">Don't go out every single night. Seriously. The biggest rookie mistake is going hard at the clubs 6 nights in a row and being completely destroyed by Day 4. The veteran move is 3-4 big nights out (Coco Bongo, The City, La Vaquita, Se&#241;or Frog's) with chill nights in between where you enjoy the resort bar, grab dinner out, or hit the hot tub early. Also, most clubs are cash-only at the door for walk-ups, so withdraw pesos during the day. And ALWAYS buy your tickets online in advance -- you'll save $10-$20 per club and skip the worst of the lines.</p>

          <p class="pro-tip-text">The single biggest way to save on Cancun spring break is going all-inclusive with a group. A group of 6-8 friends booking together can negotiate group rates that save $100-$200 per person. Also, use a no-foreign-transaction-fee credit card (like the Capital One SavorOne Student Card or Discover it Student Cash Back) to avoid getting hit with 3% fees on every purchase. And always withdraw pesos from ATMs instead of exchanging cash at the airport -- the exchange rates are way better.</p>

          <p class="section-desc">Cancun is one of the safest international spring break destinations for college students, but smart travelers stay informed. Follow these tips and you'll have a worry-free trip.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="tips-grid">
          <div class="tip-card fade-in">
            <div class="tip-card-icon">&#127961;</div>
            <h3 class="tip-card-title">Stay in the Hotel Zone</h3>
            <p class="tip-card-text">The Hotel Zone (Zona Hotelera) is a purpose-built 14-mile tourist strip with dedicated tourism police, 24/7 resort security, and a constant flow of other tourists. It's one of the safest areas in all of Mexico for visitors. Everything you need -- beaches, clubs, restaurants, shops -- is within this strip. There's really no reason to leave it unless you're on an organized tour. If you do venture into downtown Cancun, stick to well-lit, busy areas and go with a group.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="tip-card fade-in">
            <div class="tip-card-icon">&#129309;</div>
            <h3 class="tip-card-title">Use the Buddy System</h3>
            <p class="tip-card-text">This is the golden rule for any spring break trip. Never go to clubs alone, always leave with the people you came with, and share your live location with your friend group via iMessage or WhatsApp. Before going out each night, designate one person as the "responsible friend" who keeps track of the group. If someone wants to leave early, make sure they have a safe ride back to the resort. Look out for each other -- that's what good friends do.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="tip-card fade-in">
            <div class="tip-card-icon">&#127754;</div>
            <h3 class="tip-card-title">Respect the Ocean</h3>
            <p class="tip-card-text">Cancun's Caribbean side can have strong currents and rip tides, especially on the east-facing beaches. Always check the flag system before swimming: green (safe), yellow (caution), red (dangerous, don't swim). Never swim at night or after drinking. The lagoon side (west-facing) is calmer and better for inexperienced swimmers. If you get caught in a rip current, don't fight it -- swim parallel to shore until you're out of the current, then swim back in. Most beaches have lifeguards during the day.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="tip-card fade-in">
            <div class="tip-card-icon">&#9728;</div>
            <h3 class="tip-card-title">Sun Protection is Serious</h3>
            <p class="tip-card-text">Cancun is at 21 degrees latitude -- the sun is significantly stronger than what you're used to in the US. Apply SPF 50+ sunscreen every 2 hours and after swimming. Wear a hat and sunglasses during peak hours (11 AM - 3 PM). A bad sunburn on Day 1 can ruin your entire trip. Buy reef-safe sunscreen (required at many eco-parks and cenotes). Drink tons of water throughout the day -- dehydration combined with sun exposure and alcohol is the number one reason students end up at the resort clinic.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="tip-card fade-in">
            <div class="tip-card-icon">&#128179;</div>
            <h3 class="tip-card-title">Money & Valuables</h3>
            <p class="tip-card-text">Use your resort's in-room safe for your passport, extra cash, and electronics when you go out. Carry only what you need -- one card, some pesos, your phone, and your room key. Keep your phone in a front pocket or crossbody bag (no back pockets in crowded clubs). Use ATMs inside banks or your hotel lobby for the best exchange rates, not street-side ATMs. Alert your bank before traveling so your cards don't get frozen. Tip in pesos when possible -- 15-20% is standard in Mexico.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="tip-card fade-in">
            <div class="tip-card-icon">&#128663;</div>
            <h3 class="tip-card-title">Transportation Safety</h3>
            <p class="tip-card-text">Only use official taxis (look for the taxi sign and license plate starting with "T"), Uber (yes, Uber works in Cancun), or your resort's taxi service. Never accept rides from unofficial vehicles. The R-1 public bus runs the entire length of the Hotel Zone for just 12 pesos ($0.70) and is perfectly safe during the day. For nightlife, Uber is your best bet -- it's cheap, tracked, and you can share your ride status with friends. Pre-book airport transfers through your resort to avoid the aggressive taxi touts outside the terminal.</p>

          <p class="section-desc">Don't just take our word for it. Here's what actual college students said after their Cancun spring break trips. Unfiltered advice from people who've been there, done that, and have the sunburn to prove it.</p>

                &#8220;Split an Airbnb 6 ways in the Hotel Zone for $35/night each. Best financial decision of my life. We had a full kitchen so we made breakfast every morning, pregamed on the balcony overlooking the lagoon, and walked to the clubs. Saved probably $400 compared to friends who did all-inclusive and honestly had just as good of a time. The money we saved went straight into excursions and nightlife.&#8221;

                &#8220;Skip the resort lunch buffet. Walk 2 blocks to the local taco stands. $2 tacos that are 10x better. I'm not exaggerating -- the al pastor from street vendors is the best thing I've ever eaten. We found this tiny place called Tacos Rigo near the Party Center and ate there literally every day. My friends who stayed at the resort buffet the whole time missed out on the best food in Mexico.&#8221;

                &#8220;We did the budget version and honestly had MORE fun than the resort kids. Hostel bar crawls hit different when you're meeting people from Brazil, Australia, and Germany. We shared a dorm at Mundo Joven, took the R-1 bus to the Hotel Zone every day, and spent our savings on Coco Bongo VIP and a catamaran to Isla Mujeres. Bottle service is cool but making friends from 6 countries in one night is cooler.&#8221;

                &#8220;Book Coco Bongo online before you go. The line is insane if you show up without tickets. We bought Gold Member passes on their website for $70 each and walked right past the 200-person line at the door. Also, go on a weeknight if you can -- Tuesday and Wednesday shows are just as insane but way less packed. We went on a Wednesday and had room to actually dance instead of being pressed against strangers.&#8221;

          <p class="section-desc">Pack smart, pack light, and don't forget the stuff that'll save your trip. These eight items are the difference between "best week ever" and "I spent $80 replacing my phone at a Cancun electronics store." Learn from other students' mistakes.</p>

            <h3 class="tip-card-title">Reef-Safe Sunscreen (SPF 50+)</h3>
            <p class="tip-card-text">This isn't optional. Mexican law requires reef-safe (biodegradable) sunscreen at cenotes, eco-parks like Xcaret and Xel-Ha, and many public beaches. Regular sunscreen with oxybenzone and octinoxate damages coral reefs and you will literally be turned away at park entrances if you have the wrong kind. Buy a reef-safe SPF 50+ before you leave (brands like Sun Bum, Raw Elements, or Thinksport). It costs $12-$15 at Target or Amazon. Buying it in Cancun will cost you double. Apply every 2 hours and after swimming. The Yucatan sun at 21 degrees latitude is no joke -- a bad burn on Day 1 ruins the entire trip.</p>
          </div>

            <h3 class="tip-card-title">Waterproof Phone Case</h3>
            <p class="tip-card-text">A $10 investment that protects your $1,000 phone. You'll be in water constantly -- pools, ocean, cenotes, catamaran parties, foam parties, boat tours. A universal waterproof pouch (brands like JOTO or Mpow) lets you take underwater photos, use your phone on the beach without sand damage, and survive the inevitable drink spill at the club. You can buy these on Amazon for $8-$12 for a 2-pack. Do not convince yourself you'll "just be careful." You will drop your phone in water. It's not a question of if, it's when. The cenote photos alone are worth the investment -- underwater shots in crystal-clear turquoise water are pure gold.</p>

          <div class="tip-card fade-in">

            <h3 class="tip-card-title">Portable Charger (20,000mAh)</h3>
            <p class="tip-card-text">Your phone is your camera, your map, your Uber, your group chat, and your lifeline. Clubs, beach days, and excursions will drain your battery faster than you think, and there's nothing worse than being at 2% at 1 AM trying to Uber home from The City. Get a 20,000mAh portable charger (Anker is the gold standard, $25-$35 on Amazon) -- it'll give you 4-5 full charges and last the entire trip. Charge it overnight and throw it in your bag every day. Share it with friends and become the most popular person in the group. Also bring a 6-foot charging cable -- hotel outlets in Mexico are often in weird places far from the bed.</p>

            <div class="tip-card-icon">&#128087;</div>
            <h3 class="tip-card-title">Light Cover-Up</h3>
            <p class="tip-card-text">Cancun is a beach destination but you can't walk into restaurants, malls, or clubs wearing just a swimsuit. Many Hotel Zone restaurants have a casual dress code that requires at least a cover-up or shorts and a shirt. Pack a lightweight linen shirt, sundress, or sarong that you can throw over your swimwear for transitions from beach to lunch to shopping. For nightlife, most clubs enforce a dress code -- no flip-flops, no tank tops on guys, no swimwear. Pack one "going out" outfit that's comfortable in the heat: a breathable button-down or nice t-shirt for guys, a light dress or romper for women. You don't need to dress up -- just not look like you just came from the pool.</p>

            <div class="tip-card-icon">&#128181;</div>
            <h3 class="tip-card-title">Cash in Small Bills</h3>
            <p class="tip-card-text">Mexico runs on tips and many street food vendors, taxi drivers, and small shops are cash-only. Withdraw pesos from ATMs inside banks or your hotel lobby (best exchange rates, safest locations) and keep small bills on hand: 50-peso and 100-peso notes are ideal. Budget 200-300 pesos per day for tips, street food, and small purchases. Tip 15-20% at sit-down restaurants, 20-50 pesos for hotel housekeeping per day, 30-50 pesos for airport shuttle drivers, and 10-20 pesos for bag handlers. US dollars are accepted at many tourist spots but you'll get a worse exchange rate. Pro tip: avoid exchanging money at the airport -- the rates are terrible. ATMs give you the bank rate which is significantly better.</p>

          <div class="tip-card fade-in">
            <div class="tip-card-icon">&#129406;</div>
            <h3 class="tip-card-title">Comfortable Walking Sandals</h3>
            <p class="tip-card-text">Not flip-flops. Actual walking sandals with a strap and some support. You'll log 10,000-15,000 steps daily between beach walks, exploring Chichen Itza, wandering Isla Mujeres, walking the Hotel Zone strip, and standing in club lines. Cheap flip-flops will give you blisters and zero arch support. Invest in a pair of Chacos, Tevas, Birkenstocks, or even sport sandals from Nike or Adidas. They need to be comfortable for walking AND appropriate for getting wet. You'll wear these 80% of the trip. For nightlife, pack one pair of clean sneakers or casual shoes -- many clubs won't let you in with sandals. Your feet will thank you on Day 5 when your flip-flop friends are limping.</p>

            <div class="tip-card-icon">&#128167;</div>
            <h3 class="tip-card-title">Reusable Water Bottle</h3>
            <p class="tip-card-text">Tap water in Cancun is NOT safe to drink. This is non-negotiable -- do not drink the tap water, do not use it to brush your teeth, do not get ice from unknown sources (resort and restaurant ice is purified and safe). Bring a reusable water bottle and refill it at your hotel's purified water station -- most resorts and many Airbnbs have filtered water dispensers or 5-gallon garrafones available 24/7. Staying hydrated is absolutely critical when you're combining sun, alcohol, dancing, and physical activities. Dehydration is the number one reason spring breakers end up at the resort medical clinic. A 32oz Nalgene or HydroFlask will save you from buying $3 plastic water bottles all week and reduce plastic waste.</p>

            <div class="tip-card-icon">&#128138;</div>
            <h3 class="tip-card-title">Motion Sickness Meds</h3>
            <p class="tip-card-text">Even if you don't normally get motion sick, pack Dramamine or Bonine just in case. The catamaran to Isla Mujeres, the ferry ride, snorkeling boat trips, and the 2.5-hour bus ride to Chichen Itza can all trigger unexpected nausea, especially if you're tired, dehydrated, or recovering from the night before. Chewable Dramamine (less drowsy formula) is your best bet -- take it 30 minutes before boat trips. The Caribbean can get choppy, and there's nothing worse than being seasick on a party catamaran surrounded by 50 people having the time of their lives. This is a $5 purchase at any pharmacy that could save an entire day of your trip. Also useful: Pepto-Bismol tablets for the inevitable "I ate something adventurous" stomach situation.</p>

        <div class="pro-tip fade-in">
          <div class="pro-tip-label">&#128161; Pro Tip</div>
          <p class="pro-tip-text">Pack everything in a carry-on if possible. Lost luggage on a 5-7 day trip is devastating and international bag claims take forever. A standard carry-on and personal item can fit everything you need for Cancun -- you're wearing swimsuits and shorts most of the time anyway. Roll your clothes instead of folding to save space. Keep your passport, phone charger, one change of clothes, and sunscreen in your personal item (backpack) in case your carry-on gets gate-checked. And leave room in your bag for souvenirs -- you will buy tequila at Duty Free. Everyone does.</p>

            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>The best time for Cancun spring break is mid-February through late March. March is the peak month with the biggest crowds and best party atmosphere, especially the second and third weeks when most US colleges have their spring break. February is slightly cheaper and less crowded but still warm (80-85&#176;F). Early April works too but you'll miss the peak spring break energy. Weather is consistently sunny and hot with very little rain during these months. Book flights and hotels by November-December for the best deals.</p>

            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>Yes, Cancun's Hotel Zone is very safe for tourists and is heavily patrolled by dedicated tourism police. The Hotel Zone is a 14-mile strip of resorts, restaurants, and clubs built specifically for international tourism, and Mexico's government invests heavily in keeping it secure because tourism is a massive part of the local economy. Stick to the Hotel Zone and well-known areas, use the buddy system at night, only take official taxis or Uber, keep valuables in your hotel safe, and don't accept drinks from strangers. Over 30,000 college students visit during spring break season every year and the infrastructure is built for it.</p>

            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>The legal drinking age in Cancun and all of Mexico is 18 years old. This is one of the main reasons Cancun is so popular with college students -- even freshmen and sophomores can legally drink at bars, clubs, and all-inclusive resorts. You'll need a valid photo ID to enter clubs and purchase alcohol. Your passport is the best ID to carry, but most establishments also accept a US driver's license. Carry a photocopy of your passport as backup and keep the original in your hotel safe.</p>

            </button>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>For spring break, all-inclusive is almost always the better deal for college students. An all-inclusive includes unlimited food, drinks (alcoholic and non-alcoholic), pool and beach access, and often entertainment for one flat price of $80-$200/night per person. A regular hotel might be $50-$80/night but you'll easily spend $50-$100/day on food and drinks separately. All-inclusive also eliminates surprise charges and makes budgeting way easier. Popular all-inclusive resorts for college groups include Oasis Cancun Lite (budget), Grand Oasis Cancun (mid-range), Temptation Resort (adults-only party resort), and Hotel Riu Cancun (upscale). Book through CheapCaribbean or Apple Vacations for the best package deals.</p>

            </button>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>The best spring break beaches are Playa Forum (aka Forum Beach) -- the epicenter of spring break action located right next to Coco Bongo and the Forum by the Sea mall. Playa Delfines is the most beautiful public beach with the iconic Cancun sign, perfect for Instagram. Playa Tortugas is great for water sports and has a public ferry to Isla Mujeres. Playa Chac Mool is a popular mid-Hotel Zone beach with calmer waters ideal for swimming. Playa Langosta has the calmest water on the Hotel Zone and is great for relaxed beach days. Most all-inclusive resorts also have their own private beach sections with lounge chairs, umbrellas, and waitstaff bringing drinks right to you.</p>

            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>Cancun's nightlife during spring break is world-class and absolutely legendary. The Party Center in the Hotel Zone is where the action concentrates. Top clubs include Coco Bongo (multi-level show club with acrobats, confetti, and celebrity impersonators -- cover $60-$80 including open bar), The City (one of the largest clubs in Latin America, capacity 5,000+, top DJs), Mandala (upscale nightclub with great music and a rooftop), La Vaquita (rowdy party bar with foam parties and body paint), Palazzo (trendy nightclub), and Se&#241;or Frog's (casual party restaurant/bar, great for early nights). Most clubs don't get going until midnight and stay open until 5-6 AM. Cover charges of $40-$80 almost always include open bar. Many resorts also host pool parties and foam parties during the day.</p>

            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>To score the best Cancun spring break deals: book 3-4 months in advance (November-December for March trips), travel with a group of 4-8 friends to split costs and unlock group rates, use student travel sites like StudentUniverse for discounted flights, compare all-inclusive packages on CheapCaribbean, Apple Vacations, and Costco Travel, fly mid-week (Tuesday-Thursday departures are cheaper), look for package deals that bundle flights + hotel + transfers, and follow Cancun resort social media accounts for flash sales. Going during the first or last week of spring break season is also cheaper than the peak middle weeks. Sign up for price alerts on Google Flights and Hopper to track fare drops. Finally, consider flexible dates -- sometimes shifting your trip by just 2-3 days can save $100+ per person.</p>

            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>Yes, Cancun remains one of the safest international destinations for college spring breakers in 2026. The Hotel Zone (Zona Hotelera) is a 14-mile strip that is heavily patrolled by dedicated tourism police, with 24/7 security at every resort and a constant police presence throughout the nightlife district. The Mexican government invests significantly in tourist safety because Cancun's economy depends on it -- over 6 million international visitors come annually. Stick to the Hotel Zone and well-established tourist areas, use official taxis or Uber (never accept rides from unmarked vehicles), travel with your group using the buddy system at night, keep valuables in your hotel safe, and don't wander alone outside the Hotel Zone after dark. The U.S. Consulate in Cancun also provides assistance to American travelers if needed. Use common sense -- the same safety awareness you'd use in any major US city -- and you'll be perfectly fine.</p>

              <p>Yes, the legal drinking age in Mexico is 18 years old, which applies to all of Cancun including bars, clubs, restaurants, and all-inclusive resorts. This is one of the primary reasons Cancun is so popular with college students -- freshmen and sophomores who can't legally drink in the US can enjoy the full nightlife experience in Cancun. All clubs, bars, and liquor stores allow 18+ entry and purchase. You will need a valid photo ID to enter nightclubs and buy alcohol. Your passport is the gold standard and universally accepted. Most clubs will also accept a US driver's license, but some can be strict, so always carry your passport or a high-quality photocopy. Keep the original passport in your hotel safe and carry the copy as your everyday ID. There's no separate "drinking" vs "entry" age -- if you're 18, you can drink and enter every venue in Cancun.</p>

            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>The second and third weeks of March are peak spring break in Cancun -- this is when the most US colleges have their break, the biggest crowds descend, and the nightlife, pool parties, and beach events are at maximum intensity. If you want the quintessential spring break atmosphere with 50,000+ college students, this is when to go. The first week of March is a sweet spot -- still great weather and energy but noticeably cheaper (10-20% less on flights and hotels) with smaller, more manageable crowds. Late February is the "early bird" window with even lower prices but fewer organized spring break events. Avoid going after mid-April -- the spring break crowds thin out, many special events end, and the heat and humidity start ramping up toward summer levels. Weather-wise, February through March is ideal: 80-88&#176;F, low humidity, sunny skies, and almost zero rain.</p>

              <span>Should I get an all-inclusive or book separately?</span>

            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>Both approaches work and it depends on your group's priorities. All-inclusive is easier and stress-free -- one price covers your room, unlimited food and drinks, pool, beach, and entertainment. You never think about money during the trip, which is liberating. However, all-inclusive is typically pricier upfront ($120-$250/night per person) and locks you into the resort for meals. Booking separately gives you more flexibility and usually saves 20-30% overall. You can eat street tacos for $2 instead of resort buffet food, explore downtown restaurants, and split an Airbnb for much less than a resort room. The sweet spot that experienced spring breakers recommend: book a mid-range hotel or Airbnb with breakfast included or a kitchen, eat street food and local restaurants for lunch ($5-$10), and splurge on one nice dinner out per trip ($20-$30). This hybrid approach typically costs $60-$90/day total for food and accommodation vs. $120-$200+ for all-inclusive, and you'll eat better food and see more of real Cancun.</p>

              <p>Yes, US citizens need a valid passport book to fly to Cancun (passport cards are NOT accepted for air travel to Mexico). Your passport must be valid for at least 6 months beyond your travel dates -- check the expiration date now and apply for a new one or renewal if needed. Standard passport processing takes 6-8 weeks, so apply at least 2 months before your trip. Expedited processing is available for an additional $60 and takes 2-3 weeks. If you're in a real rush, emergency passport services through agencies or the State Department can turn it around in 24-72 hours but cost significantly more. When you fly to Mexico, you'll receive a Forma Migratoria M&#250;ltiple (FMM) tourist card -- this is either distributed on the plane or processed electronically at immigration. Keep this card safe because you need it to leave Mexico. You do NOT need a visa for tourist stays under 180 days. Make a photocopy of your passport's photo page and keep it in a separate location from the original -- if your passport is lost or stolen, this copy makes the replacement process much faster at the US Consulate.</p>
