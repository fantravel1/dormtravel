For international trips to Europe, plan for 7-10 days minimum to justify the flight cost and jet lag. Study abroad semesters are 3-5 months. A long weekend (Thursday to Sunday) works great for road trips and nearby cities, while a full week is best for tropical and international destinations."

You'll get warm weather, fewer crowds, and prices 20-40% lower than peak summer (July-August). Summer break works well but is the most expensive and crowded. Winter break (December-January) is great for Christmas markets in Germany and Austria, and budget flights are often cheapest in January-February. Spring break (March-April) is hit or miss weather-wise but offers decent prices."

Spring break trips to beach destinations like Cancun or Miami typically run <strong>5-7 days</strong>. For international trips to Europe, plan for <strong>7-10 days minimum</strong> to justify the flight cost and jet lag.

Summer break works well but is the most expensive and crowded. <strong>Winter break</strong> (December-January) is great for Christmas markets in Germany and Austria. Spring break (March-April) is hit or miss weather-wise but offers decent prices. Budget flights are often cheapest in <strong>January-February</strong>.</p>
