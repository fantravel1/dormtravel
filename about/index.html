            DormTravel exists because college travel is different. It's not about luxury resorts or retirement cruises. It's about cramming 6 friends into an Airbnb, finding $5 street food in a new city, and creating the stories you'll tell at every reunion for the rest of your life.
          </p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-lg);">
            We're not a booking site. We're not trying to sell you anything. We're a knowledge and inspiration hub that helps you answer: <strong style="color: var(--text);">Where should we go? How do we afford it? What should we know before we go?</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Every destination guide, budget tip, and safety resource on DormTravel is written specifically for the college experience. Because your trip to Cancun with your roommates is nothing like your parents' anniversary vacation.

          <h2 class="section-title" style="text-align:center;">From a Dorm Room to <span class="gradient-text">a Global Movement</span></h2>
        </div>

        <div class="fade-in" style="font-size: 1.05rem; color: var(--text-muted); line-height: 1.8; text-align: center;">
          <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-lg);">
            DormTravel started exactly where you'd expect: in a college dorm room. During sophomore year, our founders were trying to plan a spring break trip on a shoestring budget and realized that every travel site out there was built for people with real jobs and real salaries. The advice was useless for students splitting a rental car four ways and eating gas station snacks to save money. So they opened a laptop, bought a cheap domain, and started writing the travel guides they wished existed. The first post was a budget breakdown of a road trip from Austin to Big Bend National Park. It cost $47 per person. It got 12 views. But it was honest, it was real, and it was the start of something much bigger.
          </p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-lg);">
            The spark that lit the fire was a semester abroad in Lisbon. One of our co-founders arrived in Portugal with $1,200 to last three months and zero idea how to navigate a foreign country on a student budget. Through trial, error, and a lot of cheap sardines, they figured it out and started documenting every hack, every hidden gem, every mistake. Those raw, unfiltered posts resonated with thousands of students who were planning their own study abroad experiences and couldn't find advice that matched their reality. The comment sections exploded with students sharing their own tips, and DormTravel transformed from a one-person blog into a community.
          </p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-lg);">
            What began as a scrappy blog with a handful of destination guides has grown into a comprehensive travel resource covering 500+ destinations across 45 countries, with content available in 10 languages. We've built a team of student writers, editors, and contributors from universities around the world. Our guides have been cited by study abroad offices, featured in national media, and most importantly, used by tens of thousands of students to plan trips they'll never forget. Every piece of content still goes through the same filter we applied to that very first post: is this useful, honest, and written for someone who's balancing a course load with a travel dream?
          </p>
          <p>
            Our vision is bold but simple: to become the number one travel platform for college students globally. We want every student, regardless of where they go to school, what language they speak, or how much money they have, to see DormTravel as their go-to resource before any trip. We're building a world where planning a trip is as natural a part of the college experience as choosing a major. The dorm room where it all started is long gone, but the spirit of that first $47 road trip lives in everything we do. Your dorm room is the starting line. We're here to help you take the first step.

        </div>
        <div class="fade-in" style="font-size: 1rem; color: var(--text-muted); line-height: 1.8;">
          <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-lg);">
            <strong style="color: var(--text);">Evidence-based research is the foundation of everything we publish.</strong> Every destination fact is verified against multiple sources before it appears on DormTravel. Prices are checked quarterly to ensure our budget breakdowns reflect real-world costs, not outdated estimates from two years ago. Safety ratings come from official government sources, local tourism boards, and on-the-ground reports. When we say a hostel costs $25 a night or a city is safe for solo travelers, we've done the homework so you don't have to.
          </p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-lg);">
            <strong style="color: var(--text);">Student-first editing shapes every word on this site.</strong> All content goes through a review process designed to ensure it speaks directly to college students, not families planning a Disney vacation or retirees booking a river cruise. Our editors ask one question above all others: would a 20-year-old with a part-time job and a packed class schedule find this useful? If the answer is no, we rewrite it. We strip out jargon, skip the fluff, and focus on the details that actually matter when you're planning a trip between midterms and finals.
          </p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-lg);">
            <strong style="color: var(--text);">Safety is not an afterthought at DormTravel; it's built into our content DNA.</strong> We use a tiered safety system across all destinations and experiences: green means go with standard precautions, yellow means exercise elevated awareness, and red means significant risks that require serious preparation or reconsideration. This system covers everything from general crime and natural hazards to nightlife safety, scam prevalence, and LGBTQ+ traveler considerations. We believe informed students make smarter decisions, and smarter decisions lead to better trips.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong style="color: var(--text);">Our content is never "set it and forget it."</strong> Guides are refreshed seasonally to reflect current prices, changing conditions, new flight routes, and real student feedback. When a destination's vibe shifts, when a popular hostel closes, or when a new budget airline launches a route, we update our guides. Students who visited a destination can flag outdated information, and our editorial team reviews and incorporates feedback on a rolling basis. The travel landscape changes fast, and DormTravel changes with it.

          <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-lg);">
            <strong style="color: var(--text);">Sustainability is central to how we think about travel, not an afterthought bolted onto our brand.</strong> DormTravel runs a carbon offset program that calculates the estimated emissions of every trip featured in our guides and provides students with easy, affordable ways to offset their travel footprint. Our eco-friendly travel guides highlight destinations with strong environmental practices, recommend green hostels and eco-lodges, and feature low-impact activities like hiking, cycling, and community-based tourism. We also publish seasonal guides on how to travel sustainably on a student budget, proving that responsible travel doesn't have to be expensive travel. Every editorial decision we make considers the environmental impact, because the places we love to explore deserve to exist for the students who come after us.
          </p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-lg);">
            <strong style="color: var(--text);">Diversity and inclusion shape every piece of content we create and every community we build.</strong> Travel should be for everyone, but the reality is that students from different backgrounds face different challenges on the road. DormTravel publishes dedicated guides for LGBTQ+ travelers, solo female travelers, students of color, students with disabilities, and first-generation travelers who may not have grown up with access to international experiences. Our contributor network reflects the diversity of the student population, and we actively recruit writers and editors from underrepresented communities to ensure our content resonates with all students, not just a privileged few. We believe the travel industry is better when every voice is heard and every story is told.
          </p>
          <p style="margin-bottom: var(--space-lg);">
            <strong style="color: var(--text);">Accessibility means making travel possible for every budget, not just the students whose parents can fund a trip.</strong> DormTravel's Wanderlust Scholarship program awards travel grants twice a year to students who demonstrate financial need and a compelling desire to explore. We publish detailed guides on how to find and apply for travel scholarships, work-exchange programs, and volunteer opportunities that cover housing and meals. Our budget calculators help students build realistic savings plans, and our content consistently features destinations and experiences that are achievable on a part-time job income. We also partner with universities to integrate travel planning into financial literacy programs, helping students see travel as an investment in their personal growth rather than an unattainable luxury.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong style="color: var(--text);">Safety is not just a section in our guides; it's a commitment backed by real resources.</strong> DormTravel offers a 24/7 emergency support line for registered community members traveling abroad, providing real-time assistance with lost passports, medical emergencies, and safety concerns. Our safety guides are reviewed by security professionals and updated continuously based on current conditions. We publish destination-specific safety briefings that go beyond generic advice, covering everything from local scam tactics and transportation safety to cultural norms and emergency contact numbers. We also run pre-departure safety webinars in partnership with university study abroad offices, giving students practical tools and confidence before they board a plane. Your safety is our responsibility, and we take it seriously every single day.

              <p>DormTravel is built exclusively for college students, which means every recommendation, budget breakdown, and safety guide reflects the reality of student travel. Unlike generic travel sites that cater to families and luxury travelers, we understand that you're splitting costs with roommates, traveling during spring break or summer, and working with a limited budget. Our content is peer-validated, our community is student-only, and our mission is to make travel accessible to every college student regardless of their financial situation.</p>
